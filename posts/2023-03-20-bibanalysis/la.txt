AB Programming is a complex learning activity that involves coordination of cognitive processes and affective states. These aspects are often considered individually in computing education research, demonstrating limited understanding of how and when students learn best. This issue confines researchers to contextualize evidence-driven outcomes when learning behaviour deviates from pedagogical intentions. Multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) captures data essential for measuring constructs (e.g., cognitive load, confusion) that are posited in the learning sciences as important for learning, and cannot effectively be measured solely with the use of programming process data (IDE-log data). Thus, we augmented IDE-log data with physiological data (e.g., gaze data) and participants' facial expressions, collected during a debugging learning activity. The findings emphasize the need for learning analytics that are consequential for learning, rather than easy and convenient to collect. In that regard, our paper aims to provoke productive reflections and conversations about the potential of MMLA to expand and advance the synergy of learning analytics and learning design among the community of educators from a post-evaluation design-aware process to a permanent monitoring process of adaptation.

DE Learning analytics; Learning design; Empirical studies
AB As the fields of learning analytics and learning design mature, the convergence and synergies between them become an important area for research. Collecting and combining learning analytics coming from different channels can clearly provide valuable information in designing learning. Hence, this paper intends to summarize the main outcomes of a systematic literature review of empirical evidence on learning analytics for learning design. The search was performed in seven academic databases, resulting in 38 papers included in the main analysis. The review demonstrates ongoing design patterns and learning phenomena that improve learning, by providing more comprehensive background of the current landscape of learning analytics for learning design and its impact on the current status of learning technologies. Consequently, future research should consider how to capture and systematize learning design data. Moreover, it should evaluate and document what learning design choices made by educators using what learning analytics techniques influence learning experiences and learning performances over time.

AB This paper describes seamless learning analytics methods of VASCORLL (Visualization and Analysis System for COnnecting Relationships of Learning Logs). VASCORLL is a system for visualizing and analyzing the learning logs collected by the seamless learning system, which supports language learning in the real-world. As far, several studies have been made in the seamless learning environments in order to bridge formal learning over informal learning. However, their focus was the implementation of the seamless learning environment in education. This study focuses on visualizing and analyzing learning logs collected in the seamless learning environment. This paper describes how our analytics could contribute to bridging the gap between formal and informal learning. An experiment was conducted to evaluate 1) whether our developed VASCORLL is effective in connecting the words learned in formal learning to the ones learned in informal learning, 2) which social network algorithm is effective to enhance learning in the seamless learning environment. Twenty international students participated in the evaluation experiment, and they were able to increase their learning opportunities by using VASCORLL. In addition, it was found that the betweenness centrality is useful in finding central words bridging formal and informal learning.(1)

AB The paper aims to analyse application of learning analytics / educational data mining (LA / EDM) to support learning personalisation and optimisation in virtual learning environment Moodle. LA / EDM are known as the measurement, collection, analysis, and reporting of data about learners and their contexts to understand and optimise learning and environments in which it occurs. In the paper, appropriate literature review is performed on LA / EDM methods and techniques that could be applied to personalise students' learning in Moodle. After that, the authors' original methodology to personalise learning is presented. First of all, existing Moodle-based learning activities and tools are analysed to be further interlinked with appropriate students' learning styles. For this purpose, Felder-Silverman learning styles model (FSLSM) is applied in the research. Students' learning styles according to FSLSM are interlinked with the most suitable Moodle-based learning activities and tools using expert evaluation method. After that, a group of students is analysed in terms of identifying their individual learner profiles according to Soloman-Felder index of learning styles questionnaire. After identifying individual learner profiles, probabilistic suitability indexes are calculated for each analysed student and each Moodle-based learning activity to identify which learning activities or tools are the most suitable for particular student. From theoretical point of view, the higher is probabilistic suitability index the better learning activity or tool fits particular student's needs. On the other hand, students practically used some learning activities or tools in real learning practice in Moodle before identifying the aforementioned probabilistic suitability indexes. Here we could hypothesise that students preferred to practically use particular Moodle-based learning activities or tools that fit their learning needs mostly. Thus, using appropriate LA / EMD methods and techniques, it would be helpful to analyse what particular learning activities or tools were practically used by these students in Moodle, and to what extent. After that, the data on practical use of Moodle-based learning activities or tools should be compared with students' probabilistic suitability indexes. In the case of any noticeable discrepancies, students' profiles and accompanied suitability indexes should be identified more precisely, and students' personal leaning paths in Moodle should be corrected according to new identified data. In this way, after several iterations, we could noticeably enhance students' learning quality and effectiveness.

AB The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Blended education has rapidly increased in the 21st century. As a result, there is a growing interest in understanding to what extent innovative and interactive educational tools and technologies can be used for designing learning content to support Blended Learning. These tools are used in different courses, however, there is no possibility of tracking whether students are obtaining the maximum benefit. Learning Analytic tools can be used for tracking purposes. However, the data obtained from these tools alone will not offer benefits for improving Learning Designs. Therefore, it is important to build a synergy between Learning Analytics and Learning Design where it is possible to improve learner performance, engagement, interactions, and satisfaction. Accumulated research in these collaborative learning technologies has proposed and evaluated multiple models, frameworks, and implementation tools that engage learners in Blended Learning Environments. However, it is unclear to what extent the synergy between Learning Analytics and Learning Design can support Blended Learning. This paper contributes with a literature review that aims at providing an answer to this by offering insights about the context of use, technologies, types of activities, and collaboration mechanisms developed that can be used to improve Blended Learning in higher education.

AB As is the case for many undergraduate STEM degree programs, computing degree programs are plagued by high attrition rates. This is especially true in early computing courses, in which failure and drop-out rates in the 35 to 50 percent range are common. By collecting learning process data as students engage in computer programming assignments, computing educators can place themselves in a position not only to better understand students' struggles, but also to better tailor instructional interventions to students' needs. We have developed OSBLE+, a learning management and analytics environment that interfaces with a computer programming environment to support the automatic collection of learners' programming process and social data as they work on programming assignments, while also providing an interactive environment for the analysis and visualization of those data. In ongoing work, we are using OSBLE+ to explore two possibilities: (a) leveraging learning and social data to strategically deliver automated learning interventions, and (b) presenting learners with visual representations of their learning data in order to prompt them to reflect on and discuss their learning processes.

AB Students' retention and dropout from degree courses before their completion continue to represent issues which challenge researchers, teachers and higher education institutions to seek solutions. Higher education institutions have been attempting different strategies to promote their students' success, among which we highlight the implementation and use of virtual learning environments (VLEs). Through the use of learning analytics in the analysis of data regarding the frequency of access to a VLE as well as the learning outcomes of a sample of 2,636 undergraduates, we aimed to identify indicators which contribute to the possible prediction of student retention and dropout situations. The methodology followed is essentially quantitative and the desk review was the main data collection tool. The data was treated by using the statistic software SPSS for the organisation and descriptive statistic presentation, as well as inferential statistics through appropriate statistic tests. The outcomes of this study resulted in contributions which enable the prediction of undergraduates' retention or dropout since we were able to prove that the lower the frequency of access to the institution's virtual learning environment, the lower the attendance to on-site lessons and the lower the number of course units in which students obtain a passing mark. Absenteeism and the lack of course units passed represent indicators of school dropout and retention. This research work reveals to be of great importance since, through a framework associated with learning analytics, it provides indicators supported by a large amount of recent and validated data, which enables us to rethink the connection between undergraduates' access to a virtual learning environment and its influence on educational attainment.

AB Students in distance education are expected to self-regulate their learning process. In this paper, we present a semester planning tool that enables learners to plan, monitor, and reflect on learning tasks over a semester. In this way, Zimmerman's model of self-regulated learning (SRL) could be mapped to an application that can be used in the established Moodle LMS. Furthermore, we introduce the Adaptation Rule Interface for implementing rule-based context-sensitive adaptations in Moodle. As a baseline for adaptive SRL support, we conducted two field studies (N = 157 and N = 93). In both studies, monitoring was used most frequently, while planning was mainly done at the beginning of the semester. Participants preferred to adjust provided milestones, instead of creating their own. Reflection played a minor role. The participants who used the tool extensively reported a strong affinity for time management and content elaboration in the LIST-K inventory. Using cluster analysis, participants with high learning activity and high SRL activity were grouped into one cluster, while the majority of participants combined into a second cluster. Through this empirical investigation of SRL processes, it is possible to design effective adaptive support for self-regulated learning.

AB There has been a growing interest in how teaching might be informed by learning design (LD), with a promising method for investigating LD being offered by the emerging field of learning analytics (LA). In this study, we used a novel LA for LD methodology to investigate the implementation of LD in an online distance learning context. A key innovation is the focus on patterns of LD. Using data from the virtual learning environment, outcomes data, and self-reports, for 47,784 students, we investigated the impact of those patterns on student behaviour, pass rates and satisfaction. A second innovation involves social network analysis. Our study revealed that different patterns of LD were associated with statistically significant differences in behaviour, but not in pass rates or satisfaction. Nonetheless, the study highlights that applying LA to LD might, in a virtuous circle, contribute to the validity and effectiveness of both, and to the enhancement of online distance learning.

AB Learning analytics is the analysis and visualization of student data with the purpose of improving education. Literature reporting on measures of the effects of data-driven pedagogical interventions on learning and the environment in which this takes place, allows us to assess in what way learning analytics actually improves learning. We conducted a systematic literature review aimed at identifying such measures of data-driven improvement. A review of 1034 papers yielded 38 key studies, which were thoroughly analyzed on aspects like objective, affected learning and their operationalization (measures). Based on prevalent learning theories, we synthesized a classification scheme comprised of four categories: learning process, student performance, learning environment, and departmental performance. Most of the analyzed studies relate to either student performance or learning process. Based on the results, we recommend to make deliberate decisions on the (multiple) aspects of learning one tries to improve by the application of learning analytics. Our classification scheme with examples of measures may help both academics and practitioners doing so, as it allows for structured positioning of learning analytics benefits.

AB This paper presents a research on the effectiveness of digital learning in Higher Education and how this can be measured. This research aims to bridge the gap between scientific and practice-oriented research about digital learning. The focus will be on learning analytics with the goal to identify the potential of digital education for Universities.
   To achieve this goal, we conducted a literature review of which have resulted in the following research questions: What are the higher education contexts in which digital learning can take place? What are the primary metrics which allows measuring the efficiency of digital learning in higher education contexts?
   The methodological approach of the research was qualitative, and the main technique to collect and analyze data was content analysis from the literature review of papers on digital learning contexts and digital learning analytics.
   The results of the present study show that digital learning analytics can enhance the efficacy of the impact of the learning process in organizations and that contexts for learning supported on mobile technologies, tablet and smartphone applications become more and more popular among the students.

DE Learning styles; learning analytics; e-learning; personalized learning
   environment
AB Learning analytics (LA) i.e. the collection, analyses and reporting of learners' or learning activity data, is a topic of great importance in any learning-related research. Learning analytics is used for purposes of understanding, optimizing and improving learning and the environment in which learning occurs. Basically, it could be said that the aim of LA is to get answers on "Who is doing what, how and why?" Since all parts of a learning process are connected and somehow influence one another finding the answers is a complex process that requires detailed planning and proceeding. The complexity of answers is especially present in Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) since it is a heterogenic environment involving different participants, tools, materials and ways for its realization.
   In this contribution, we focus on investigating who is doing what, by starting from the fact that students have different learning habits and that they proceed through learning in various ways i.e. they have different learning styles. As so, by who, we refer to which learning style is taking which actions. Considering learning styles and correlating it with analytics data can provide deeper understating of LA, especially in personalized learning environments (PLE), since learning style, by definition "refer to the preferential way in which the student absorbs, processes, comprehends and retains information".
   In our work, we will rely on Felder-Silverman learning style model (FSLSM), as one of the most relevant and widely used model in determination of learners learning style in TEL. Index of learning style (ILS), a questionnaire created for identification of learning styles based on FSLSM, will be integrated and used. Further, recommendations and guides for both instructors and students will be given based on previous work and researches on FSLSM.
   In this regard, we present a conceptual model of learning analytics tool for analysing and visualizing data correlations between students' learning styles and their behaviour within an e-learning environment. The implementation is planned to be a plugin for the Learning Management System Moodle (Moodle LMS) that will collect data on learners' actions, correlate it with learners' learning style and presents it in multiple forms of visualization.
   This plugin will enable users to identify their individual learning style as well as provide additional information and recommendations for their learning habits. Using such a plugin will enable students to gain insights into their individual learning styles as well as learning styles of their peers, i.e. other students in the course or in an assigned group. On the other hand, teachers will have insight on distribution of learning styles in their courses as well as how different learning styles behave in course (e.g. which materials they use, what content they access, in which activities they participate).
   While learners will benefit from actually knowing their learning style, and thus how best to approach certain kinds of information, teachers will hugely benefit from comparing individual learning styles with the average learner in their courses, and also with their own way of teaching. Thus, both the structure of the course and the used materials can be tailored to the learners' needs, if necessary. In that way, teachers can modify their learning materials, curriculums or even their teaching style in order to create more personalized and adapted learning experience.

AB E-learning platforms are being used in higher education to liberate teaching and learning from the constraints of time, pace, and space. These platforms provide rich media content, collaborative assessment, and analytics tools and support learning through a variety of online possibilities. However, the focus of most of this research is on learning analytics inside e-learning platforms and does not cover other related institutional surveys and educator professional development activities. This paper outlines a novel conceptual approach for the creation of a teaching and learning data warehouse analytics system that utilizes a Multi-Dimensional Analysis approach to teaching and learning analytics across these e-learning platforms in combination with other institutional data sources, such as various institutional surveys, tracking of professional development activities, and analysis of the use of the learning management system. The novel teaching and learning data warehouse analytics system (TLDWAS) is being developed at Lingnan University, a leading liberal arts university in Hong Kong. The genesis of this project is analyzing large volumes of teaching and learning data and presenting a big picture for senior management to gain insight from massive amounts of student courses and teacher evaluation data, fill the research gaps mentioned above, and help educators identify problems and solutions more effectively. The TLDWAS provides a visual interface for identifying some indicators and storing, classifying, and analyzing teaching and learning data in various forms to generate statistics, analyze models, and identify meaningful patterns in the data in order to improve teaching and learning. The TLDWAS not only provides more evidence-based decision-making for senior management but is also capable of being applied to identify patterns and relations pertaining to students' academic performance, usage of e-learning systems, and associated staff development activities.

   Content Personalisation
AB The efforts towards providing personalised e-learning is an increasing trend due to the fact that content provision is usually a one size fits all approach. Students' have different learning styles, skills and needs which dictate the way in which they learn. This paper presents an adaptive educational system called iPal (Integrated Personalised Assessment in Learning). iPal is designed to be a more effective learning environment to satisfy the online delivery of theoretical and practical Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) subjects, as a supplementary course tool in higher education. The practical approach of iPal specifically addresses the lack of game based learning in adaptive educational systems. The focus of this paper is based on a two tiered approach using the implicit approach of learning analytics with educational data mining and the explicit approach of learning styles to personalise content in iPal. This paper discusses how these approaches are effective enablers in the delivery of personalised content. A case study demonstrating the practical application of the iPal system is presented comprising of over 100 undergraduate Computing students'. The key significance of this research is that it provides clear evidence for the successful use of iPal as a supplementary course tool in higher education.

AB This exploratory paper highlights how problem-based learning (PBL) provided the pedagogical framework used to design and interpret learning analytics from Crystal Island: EcoJourneys, a collaborative game-based learning environment centred on supporting science inquiry. In Crystal Island: EcoJourneys, students work in teams of four, investigate the problem individually and then utilize a brainstorming board, an in-game PBL whiteboard that structured the collaborative inquiry process. The paper addresses a central question: how can PBL support the interpretation of the observed patterns in individual actions and collaborative interactions in the collaborative game-based learning environment? Drawing on a mixed method approach, we first analyzed students' pre- and post-test results to determine if there were learning gains. We then used principal component analysis (PCA) to describe the patterns in game interaction data and clustered students based on the PCA. Based on the pre- and post-test results and PCA clusters, we used interaction analysis to understand how collaborative interactions unfolded across selected groups. Results showed that students learned the targeted content after engaging with the game-based learning environment. Clusters based on the PCA revealed four main ways of engaging in the game-based learning environment: students engaged in low to moderate self-directed actions with (1) high and (2) moderate collaborative sense-making actions, (3) low self-directed with low collaborative sense-making actions and (4) high self-directed actions with low collaborative sense-making actions. Qualitative interaction analysis revealed that a key difference among four groups in each cluster was the nature of verbal student discourse: students in the low to moderate self-directed and high collaborative sense-making cluster actively initiated discussions and integrated information they learned to the problem, whereas students in the other clusters required more support. These findings have implications for designing adaptive support that responds to students' interactions with in-game activities.

DE Measurement of learning; IRT; validation; learning analytics
AB Learning analysts often claim to measure learning, but their work has attracted growing concern about whether or not the measures are sufficiently accurate, fair, reliable, and valid, with utility for educators and interpretable by them. This paper considers these issues in the light of practices of scholars in more established fields, educational measurement particularly. The focus is on what really matters about methodologies for measuring learning, including foundational assumptions about the nature of learning, what is understood by the term 'measured', the criteria applied when assessing quality of data, the standards of proof required to establish validity, reliability, generalizability, utility and interpretability of findings, and assumptions about learners and learning underlying data modeling techniques used to abstract meaning from the data. This paper argues that, for learning analytics to take its place as a fully-fledged member of the learning sciences, it needs seriously to consider how to measure learning. Methodology crafted at the interface of measurement science and learning analytics may be of sufficient interest to create a new subfield of scholarship - dubbed here 'metrilytics' - to make a distinctive contribution to the science of learning.

AB As technology progresses, understanding online learner's behavior is the key for successful implementation of digital learning. The more we know about learners, the more tailored learning experiences will be. Analyzing the learner's preferences will help to predict the behavior of learner's so that required support and guidance can be provided on time. For achieving this much more efficient systems are required to process all types of the learner interactions with the learning management system during their each learning activity. This paper discusses the importance of learning analytics, and presents its usage in eLearning. It describes how learning analytics can help the learners, instructors and institutions to look into ongoing learning processes and how the online educational processes can be improved. It also depicts about the proposed system how the learning styles can be used for improving learning experience.

AB In this poster, we describe the aim and current activities of the EARLI-Centre for Innovative Research (E-CIR) "Measuring and Supporting Student's Self-Regulated Learning in Adaptive Educational Technologies" which is funded by the European Association for Research on Learning and Instruction (EARLI) from 2015 to 2019. The aim is to develop our understanding of multimodal data that unobtrusively capture cognitive, meta-cognitive, affective and motivational states of learners over time. This demands for a concerted interdisciplinary dialogue combining findings from psychology and educational sciences with advances in computer sciences and artificial intelligence. The participants in this E-CIR are leading international researchers who have articulated different emerging perspectives and methodologies to measure cognition, metacognition, motivation, and emotions during learning. The participants recognize the need for intensive collaboration to accelerate progress with new interdisciplinary methods including learning analytics to develop more powerful adaptive educational technologies.

AB As Learners move from one learning environment to another, there is a key necessity of taking with them a proof of previous learning achievements or experiences. In most cases, this is either expressed in terms of receipt of scores or a certificate of completion. While this may be sufficient for enrollment and other administrative decisions, it poses some limitations to the depth of learning analytics and consequently a slow onboarding process. Also, with different institutions having their learning data isolated from each other, it becomes more difficult to easily access a learner's learning history for all learning activities on other systems. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based approach for connecting learning data across different Learning Management Systems (LMS), Learning Record Stores (LRS), institutions and organizations. Leveraging on unique properties of blockchain technology, we also propose solutions to ensuring learning data consistency, availability, immutability, security, privacy and access control.

ID PERSONALIZATION
AB Advances have been made in personalised learning by the developments in learning analytics, where useful information can be extracted from educational data and analysed to devise personalised learning solutions. This paper presents a review of the literature in this area, covering a total of 144 relevant empirical articles published between 2012 and 2019 collected from Scopus. It identifies the patterns in the use of learning analytics to personalise learning in terms of the environments (what), stakeholders (who), objectives (why) and methods (how). The results show a clear growth in the number of practices, and diversity in terms of the learning contexts where learning analytics was implemented; the types of data collected; the groups of target stakeholders; the objectives of learning analytics practices; the personalised learning goals; and the analytics methods. The findings also reveal the emergence of practices related to the teacher perspective and some areas which have not been fully addressed, such as personalised intervention for future work.

AB Self-regulated learning (SRL) can predict academic performance. Yet, it is difficult for learners. The ability to self-regulate learning becomes even more important in emerging online learning settings. To support learners in developing their SRL, learning analytics (LA), which can improve learning practice by transforming the ways we support learning, is critical. This scoping review is based on the analysis of 54 papers on LA empirical research for SRL in online learning contexts published between 2011 and 2019. The research question is: What is the current state of the applications of learning analytics to measure and support students' SRL in online learning environments? The focus is on SRL phases, methods, forms of SRL support, evidence for LA and types of online learning settings. Zimmerman's model (2002) was used to examine SRL phases. The evidence about LA was examined in relation to four propositions: whether LA i) improve learning outcomes, ii) improve learning support and teaching, iii) are deployed widely, and iv) used ethically. Results showed most studies focused on SRL parts from the forethought and performance phase but much less focus on reflection. We found little evidence for LA that showed i) improvements in learning outcomes (20%), ii) improvements in learning support and teaching (22%). LA was also found iii) not used widely and iv) few studies (15%) approached research ethically. Overall, the findings show LA research was conducted mainly to measure rather than to support SRL. Thus, there is a critical need to exploit the LA support mechanisms further in order to ultimately use them to foster student SRL in online learning environments.

AB With the wide expansion of distributed learning environments the way we learn became more diverse than ever. This poses an opportunity to incorporate different data sources of learning traces that can offer broader insights into learner behavior and the intricacies of the learning process. We argue that combining analytics across different e-learning systems can potentially measure the effectiveness of learning designs and maximize learning opportunities in distributed settings. As a step toward this goal, in this study, we considered how to broaden the context of a single learning environment into a learning ecosystem that integrates three separate e-learning systems. We present a cross-platform architecture that captures, integrates, and stores learning-related data from the learning ecosystem. To demonstrate the feasibility and the benefits of cross-platform architecture, we used regression and classification techniques to generate interpretable models with analytics that can be relevant for instructors in understanding learning behavior and sensemaking of the instructional method on learner performance. The results show that combining data across three e-learning systems improve the classification accuracy compared to data from a single learning system by a factor of 5. This article highlights the value of cross-platform learning analytics and presents a springboard for the creation of new cross-system data-driven research practices.

AB In recent years, the connection between Learning Design (LD) and Learning Analytics (LA) has been emphasized by many scholars as it could enhance our interpretation of LA findings and translate them to meaningful interventions. Together with numerous conceptual studies, a gradual accumulation of empirical evidence has indicated a strong connection between how instructors design for learning and student behaviour. Nonetheless, students' timing of engagement and its relation to LD and academic performance have received limited attention. Therefore, this study investigates to what extent students' timing of engagement aligned with instructor learning design, and how engagement varied across different levels of performance. The analysis was conducted over 28 weeks using trace data, on 387 students, and replicated over two semesters in 2015 and 2016. Our findings revealed a mismatch between how instructors designed for learning and how students studied in reality. In most weeks, students spent less time studying the assigned materials on the VLE compared to the number of hours recommended by instructors. The timing of engagement also varied, from in advance to catching up patterns. High-performing students spent more time studying in advance, while low-performing students spent a higher proportion of their time on catching-up activities. This study reinforced the importance of pedagogical context to transform analytics into actionable insights.

ID PATTERNS
AB This longitudinal study explores the effects of tracking and monitoring time devoted to learn with a mobile tool, on self-regulated learning. Graduate students (n = 36) from three different online courses used their own mobile devices to track how much time they devoted to learn over a period of four months. Repeated measures of the Online Self-Regulated Learning Questionnaire and Validity and Reliability of Time Management Questionnaire were taken along the course. Our findings reveal positive effects of tracking time on time management skills. Variations in the channel, content and timing of the mobile notifications to foster reflective practice are investigated, and time-logging patterns are described. These results not only provide evidence of the benefits of recording learning time, but also suggest relevant cues on how mobile notifications should be designed and prompted towards self-regulated learning of students in online courses.

AB Most teachers to date have adopted summative assessment items as a benchmark to measure students' learning and for making pedagogical decisions. However, these may not necessarily provide comprehensive evidence for the actual learning process, particularly in online learning environments due to their failure to monitor students' online learning patterns over time. In this paper, we explore how social learning analytics (SLA) can be used as a proxy by teachers to understand students' learning processes and to support them in making informed pedagogical decisions during the run of a course. This study was conducted in a semester-long undergraduate course, at a large public university in Norway, and made use of data from 4 weekly online discussions delivered through the university learning management system Canvas. First, we used NodeXL a social network analysis tool to analyze and visualize students' online learning processes, and then we used Coh-Metrix, a theoretically grounded, computational linguistic tool to analyze the discourse features of students' discussion posts. Our findings revealed that SLA provides insight and an overview of the students' cognitive and social learning processes in online learning environments. This exploratory study contributes to an improved conceptual understanding of SLA and details some of the methodological implications of an SLA approach to enhance teaching and learning in online learning environments.

AB In online learning environments, learners are often required to be more autonomous in their approach to learning. In scaled online learning environments, like Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), there are differences in the ability of learners to access teachers and peers to get help with their study than in more traditional educational environments. This exploratory study examines the help-seeking behaviour of learners across several MOOCs with different audiences and designs. Learning analytics techniques (e.g., dimension reduction with t-sne and clustering with affinity propagation) were applied to identify clusters and determine profiles of learners on the basis of their help-seeking behaviours. Five help seeking learner profiles were identified which provide an insight into how learners' help-seeking behaviour relates to performance. The development of a more in-depth understanding of how learners seek help in large online learning environments is important to inform the way support for learners can be incorporated into the design and facilitation of online courses delivered at scale.

AB Over a period of 4.5 months, a high school class participated in inquiry projects to self-directly learn topics from applied biology by making use of platforms and tools developed in the course of the European research projects weSPOT (http://wespot.net/) and LEA's Box (http://leas-box.eu). Overall, 34 students (24 female) aging from 14 to 17 years (M = 15.06; SD = 0.78 years) were asked to selfdirectly engage with learning resources. The learning resources have been evaluated by the students on how helpful they were in their current learning state and by the teacher with regards to the four dimensions of the Index of Learning Styles Questionnaire (ILS). The students filled out declarative knowledge pre- and posttests, the ILS and a learning logbook for the learning resource evaluation as well as the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory. Highly significant correlations have been observed between the learning analytics and the teachers' evaluation of the exercises carried out by the students, the students' self-assessment of their exercises and the number of consumed learning resources. An Analysis of Variance indicate that female students consume more learning resources and submit more and better evaluated exercises and a positive impact of intrinsic motivation for the learning resource evaluation. The quantitative results are enriched by a qualitative interview with the teacher on his experiences.

AB In the last few years, there has been a growing interest in learning analytics (LA) in technology-enhanced learning (TEL). Generally, LA deals with the development of methods that harness educational data sets to support the learning process. Recently, the concept of open learning analytics (OLA) has received a great deal of attention from LA community, due to the growing demand for self-organized, networked, and lifelong learning opportunities. A key challenge in OLA is to follow a personalized and goal-oriented LA model that tailors the LA task to the needs and goals of multiple stakeholders. Current implementations of LA rely on a predefined set of questions and indicators. There is, however, a need to adopt a personalized LA approach that engages end users in the indicator definition process by supporting them in setting goals, posing questions, and self-defining the indicators that help them achieve their goals. In this paper, we address the challenge of personalized LA and present the conceptual, design, and implementation details of a rule-based indicator definition tool to support flexible definition and dynamic generation of indicators to meet the needs of different stakeholders with diverse goals and questions in the LA exercise.

AB In the last five years, learning analytics has proved its potential in predicting academic performance based on trace data of learning activities. However, the role of pedagogical context in learning analytics has not been fully understood. To date, it has been difficult to quantify learning in a way that can be measured and compared. By coding the design of c-learning courses, this study demonstrates how learning design is being implemented on a large scale at the Open University UK, and how learning analytics could support as well as benefit from learning design. Building on our previous work, our analysis was conducted longitudinally on 23 undergraduate distance learning modules and their 40,083 students. The innovative aspect of this study is the availability of fine-grained learning design data at individual task level, which allows us to consider the connections between learning activities, and the media used to produce the activities. Using a combination of visualizations and social network analysis, our findings revealed a diversity in how learning activities were designed within and between disciplines as well as individual learning activities. By reflecting on the learning design in an explicit manner, educators are empowered to compare and contrast their design using their own institutional data.

AB Despite the proven benefits of Serious Games when compared to traditional e-learning, uptake of game-based learning in mainstream education is still very low. Increasing uptake requires making suitable games easier to deploy as an activity type in existing e-learning platforms, without compromising game quality or increase development cost; and leveraging data generated by players to improve their learning outcomes. We briefly discuss available e-learning standards to address these issues and describe our current standards-based approach to both game deployment and evaluation (including learning analytics).

AB This paper presents the results of a review of eight policies for learning analytics of relevance for higher education, and discusses how these policies have tried to address prominent challenges in the adoption of learning analytics, as identified in the literature. The results show that more considerations need to be given to establishing communication channels among stakeholders and adopting pedagogy-based approaches to learning analytics. It also reveals the shortage of guidance for developing data literacy among end-users and evaluating the progress and impact of learning analytics. Moreover, the review highlights the need to establish formalised guidelines to monitor the soundness, effectiveness, and legitimacy of learning analytics. As interest in learning analytics among higher education institutions continues to grow, this review will provide insights into policy and strategic planning for the adoption of learning analytics.

AB The purpose of fins study is to suggest more meaningful components for learning analytics in order to help learners to improve their learning achievement continuously through an educational technology approach. 41 undergraduate students in a women's university in South Korea participated in this study. The seven-predictor model was able to account for 99.3% of the variance in the final grade, F-(8,F- (32)) = 547.424, p < .001, R-2 = .993. Total login frequency in LMS, (ir)regularity of learning interval in LMS, and total assignments and assessment composites had a significant (p < .05) correlation with final grades. However, total studying time in LMS (ss=.038, t=.868, p > .05), interactions with content (ss=-.004, t=-.240, p > .05), interactions with peers (ss=.015, t=.766, p > .05), and interactions with instructor (ss=.009, t=.354, p > .05) did not predict final grades. The results provide a rationale for the treatment for student time management effort.

DE Game Based Learning; Learning Analytics; Educational Games; Game Center
AB Game-based learning has been considered in different studies as a supplementary tool if not an alternative tool for traditional classroom learning. Game-based learning (GBL), together with Personalized Learning Environment (PLE) and Learning Management Systems (LMS) are part of the digital learning environment where there is an increasing demand of converting, translating, interpreting and presenting learning-related data for different kinds of analysis - learning analytics. Learning environments such as PLEs and LMSs are the common source of these data but another rich data source is the GBL environment. Data from GBL environment are often under collected if not uncollected therefore not translated and analyzed properly.
   This research proposes a learning analytics framework applied to a digital GBL environment to be able to materialize their relationship. The proposed framework includes a way to capture, translate, present and share data from different game events that may contribute in the learning process. The research also includes a proof-of-concept implementation using iOS as the game platform and the built in Game Center of iOS for presentation of the data collected. The proposed framework and data presentation through the Game Center received a positive feedback from the stakeholders - learners and educators.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Adaptive learning and learning analytics are powerful learning tools on their own. Scholars have reported outcomes on combining them, but the lack of a summary from these studies prevents stakeholders from having a clear view of this combination. In this paper, we consider the key dimensions of learning analytics applications in adaptive learning, in order to suggest a proper reference framework that serves as the basis to systematically review the literature. The findings suggest that interesting research work has been carried out during the last years on the topic. Yet, there is a clear lack of studies (a) on school education and in topics outside STEM and (b) that do not focus solely on the (self-)reflection of students or tutors. Finally, the majority of the studies merely concentrates on narrow measures of learning like student performance. A niche area taking into account more complex student behaviors, like collaboration, is emerging.

AB This study aims to identify the types of learning logs that can measure learning skills. By using the learning analytics approach, the learning process can be analyzed. Identifying learning skills from the behavioral level can be linked to students learning behaviors and how they support their own learning. However, the skills identified from those logs were not particularly clear. Therefore, we reviewed previous studies from the databases of educational papers "ERIC" and "Google Scholar", linked the behaviors with the skills and identified the logs that can objectively reflect the behaviors. In this study, the learning skills that could he analyzed through learning logs were presented.

AB Recent developments in Learning Analytics have attracted much attention from researchers and practitioners, as well as diverse stakeholders, in exploring the potential for Learning Analytics to enhance learning and teaching practices. Hence, this paper presents a literature review of the use of the Learning Analytics Intervention implemented in various educational institutions in order to improve students' success and engagement in their learning, particularly for at-risk students. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of how Learning Analytics Intervention has been utilised in the educational institution, the types of theory applied in the intervention and what tools are used in the intervention. Additionally, the application of Learning Analytics Intervention, its purpose, effects and examples are also discussed in this paper. The findings show that most of the Learning Analytics Interventions have an impact on students' success in their learning, although some of them have little impact or no significant effect, and various Learning Analytics tools and strategies are discovered. Lastly, it is suggested that further Learning Analytics Interventions should be developed in order to meet the needs of students.

AB Learning analytics can bridge the gap between learning sciences and data analytics, leveraging the expertise of both fields in exploring the vast amount of data generated in online learning environments. A typical learning analytics intervention is the learning dashboard, a visualisation tool built with the purpose of empowering teachers and learners to make informed decisions about the learning process. Related work has investigated learning dashboards, yet none have explored the theoretical foundation that should inform the design and evaluation of such interventions. In this systematic literature review, we analyse the extent to which theories and models from learning sciences have been integrated into the development of learning dashboards aimed at learners. Our analysis revealed that very few dashboard evaluations take into account the educational concepts that were used as a theoretical foundation for their design. Furthermore, we report findings suggesting that comparison with peers, a common reference frame for contextualising information on learning analytics dashboards, was not perceived positively by all learners. We summarise the insights gathered through our literature review in a set of recommendations for the design and evaluation of learning analytics dashboards for learners.

ID MODEL
AB Learning Analytics (LA) studies the learning process in order to optimize learning opportunities for students. Although LA has quickly risen to prominence, there remain questions regarding the impact LA has made to date. To evaluate the extent that LA has impacted our understanding of learning and produced insights that have been translated to mainstream practice or contributed to theory, we reviewed the research published in 2011-2018 LAK conferences and Journal of Learning Analytics. The reviewed studies were coded according to five dimensions: study focus, data types, purpose, institutional setting, and scale of research and implementation. The coding and subsequent epistemic network analysis indicates that while LA research has developed in the areas of focus and sophistication of analyses, the impact on practice, theory and frameworks have been limited. We hypothesize that this finding is due to a continuing predominance of small-scale techno-centric exploratory studies that to date have not fully accounted for the multidisciplinarity that comprises education. For the field to reach its potential in understanding and optimizing learning and learning environments, there must be a purposeful shift to move from exploratory models to more holistic and integrative systems-level research. This necessitates greater effort applied to understanding the research cycles that emerge when multiple knowledge domains coalesce into new fields of research.

ID ISSUES
AB With the increase of online education programs, learning analytics (LA) tools have become a popular addition to many learning management systems (LMS). As a tool for supporting learning in an educational context, LA has generated some controversy among scholars. Therefore, in this text, we aim to provide a theoretical and analytical understanding of the approach and its implications for teaching and learning. To achieve this, we apply McLuhan's semiotic analysis of media (1988). The "Laws of Media" questions are asked about LA tools: What do they enhance, make obsolete, retrieve, and reverse into. By answering these questions, we outline which practices of teaching and learning are more likely to become common when LA tools are taken into use more widely and which others will be relegated. In the analysis, we point out that LA tools enhance prediction and personalization of learning, while they displace certain teachers' skills, personal interaction between teachers and students, and qualitative interpretation and assessment of learning. Simultaneously, LA retrieves behaviourist views of learning and urges discussion about data literacy. Taken to the limits, LA reverses its effects and becomes a tool for supporting awareness and reflection in teaching and learning. We consider these contributions relevant for understanding and reflecting on the type of pedagogies that LA supports, the implicit values it holds, and the changes it introduces into educational practice.

DE learning analytics; learning interaction; learner's perception
AB Big data has changed the approach in designing an e-Learning. When students interact with e-Learning content, automatically generating data, we can collect and trace their learning tracks. The data is processed and analyzed, then used to understand the behavioral characteristics of the user or student to enable a personalized learning experience. In this study, learning analytics dashboard was used to improve learning interaction which impacts the learning successfulness. Tests were conducted on 67 students in the Educational Technology Department of the State University of Malang and distributed questionnaires and then analyzed using descriptive methods. The result is that most of the students who take online learning using the learning analytics dashboard find it helpful to carry out self-evaluations of their interaction hence they can manage their learning. The results of the study showed that most participants agreed that LAD could provide information to them regarding their interactions with learning content (M = 4.15, SD = 0.557), learning environment (M = 4.13, SD = 0.457), as well as the participants could conduct problem identification during their learning process (M = 3.88, SD = 0.477).

AB Research has demonstrated a correlation between lecture attendance and students' academic achievement. However, students may not attend lectures for a variety of reasons. The provision of lecture recordings online can also negatively impact lecture attendance and student achievement. These facts implore us to be courageous and explore new approaches to improve and expand learning experiences. This paper describes how a diverse team of academics, learning analytics and education design staff at [the University of Wollongong] came together to explore this issue and develop an approach that could better support the learning of our students resulting in higher rates of achievement while adapting to students' needs for flexibility and connection. Details are given regarding the analysis of learning analytics data, and how these data have informed and directed a transformed learning design for a core undergraduate subject in the field of teacher education.

DE Educational innovation; learning scenarios; learning analytics
AB As part of its activities to promote educational innovation among local schools, Tallinn University's Center for Innovation in Education organizes learning scenarios for students at different levels of primary and secondary education. The paper gives an insight into the possibilities of using learning analytics in the process of designing such pedagogical interventions. It describes the first stages of a design-based research process, in which researchers and teacher-trainers co-create educational interventions in an authentic educational setting. The aim of this initial research was to analyze how the integration of learning analytics helps to move a pedagogical intervention from the piloting phase to later implementation. In this particular context learning analytics provided information about student collaboration, task quality, and engagement profiles coming from different data sources, that could be analyzed individually, group and task wise. The output of these analyses not only made the learning process and effectiveness more visible for teachers, but also provided actionable feedback on how to improve the design of such complex learning scenarios, where different levels of engagement and forms of collaboration take place. These learning analytics techniques are not intended as a substitute for strong qualitative content analysis, but rather as a complement, as the combination of both provides sufficient information to develop complex learning scenarios which support meaningful learning and active collaboration.

AB In recent years, in the field of education, there has been a clear progressive trend toward precision education. As a rapidly evolving AI technique, machine learning is viewed as an important means to realize it. In this paper, we systematically review 40 empirical studies regarding machine-learning-based precision education. The results showed that the majority of studies focused on the prediction of learning performance or dropouts, and were carried out in online or blended learning environments among university students majoring in computer science or STEM, whereas the data sources were divergent. The commonly used machine learning algorithms, evaluation methods, and validation approaches are presented. The emerging issues and future directions are discussed accordingly.

AB Many adult second and foreign language learners have insufficient opportunities to engage in language learning. However, their successful acquisition of a target language is critical for various reasons, including their fast integration in a host country and their smooth adaptation to new work or educational settings. This suggests that they need additional support to succeed in their second language acquisition. We argue that such support would benefit from recent advances in the fields of mobile-assisted language learning, self-regulated language learning, and learning analytics. In particular, this paper offers a conceptual framework, mobile-assisted language learning through learning analytics for self-regulated learning (MALLAS), to help learning designers support second language learners through the use of learning analytics to enable self-regulated learning. Although the MALLAS framework is presented here as an analytical tool that can be used to operationalise the support of mobileassisted language learning in a specific exemplary learning context, it would be of interest to researchers who wish to better understand and support self-regulated language learning in mobile contexts.
   Implications for practice and policy:
   MALLAS is a conceptual framework that captures the dimensions of self-regulated language learning and learning analytics that are required to support mobile-assisted language learning.
   Designers of mobile-assisted language learning solutions using MALLAS will have a solution with sound theoretically underpinned solution.
   Learning designers can use MALLAS as a guide to direct their design choices regarding the development of mobile-assisted language learning apps and services.

AB The increase of interactive learning environments, such as learning management systems, personal learning environments and intelligent tutoring systems, generates large amounts of data. Nevertheless, in the majority of cases, the data stored in these environments, either in files or databases, are underused by teachers, students and institutions. The analysis of these data generates a space for the increase of research in topics related to evaluation of learning theories, early warning systems, and the development of future learning applications.
   Several researches have shown the use of learning analytics, machine learning, data mining techniques and classifiers to predict on the issue of learning outcomes in students. Nevertheless, it is necessary to guide the study of methods and techniques of data mining and learning analytics classifying them according to the actors and use objectives. This paper presents a summary of the most relevant approaches of the use of techniques and tools of educational data mining and learning analytics, using Learning Management Systems platform's in higher education.

AB This workshop aims to promote strategic planning for learning analytics in higher education through developing institutional policies. While adoption of learning analytics is predominantly seen in small-scale and bottom-up patterns, it is believed that a systemic implementation can bring the widest impact to the education system and lasting benefits to learners. However, the success of it highly depends on the adopted strategy that meets the needs of various stakeholders and systematically pushes the institution towards achieving its targets. It is imperative to develop a learning analytics policy that ensures a practice that is valid, effective and ethical.
   The workshop involves two components. The first component includes a set of presentations about the state of learning analytics in higher education, drawing on results from an Australian and a European project examining institutional learning analytics policy and adoption processes. The second component is an interactive session where participants are encouraged to share their motivations for adopting learning analytics and the diversity of challenges they perceive impede analytics adoption in their institution. Using the RAPID Outcome Mapping Approach (ROMA), participants will create a draft policy that articulates how the various challenges can be addressed. This workshop aims to further develop our understanding of how learning analytics operates in an organizational system and promote a cultural change in how such analytics are adopted in higher education.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB With the increasing interest of social media usage among the students, we are motivated to integrate this informal mode of socialized learning environment into the formal learning system to engage students for their learning activities. The existing Learning Analytics (LA) focused only on analyzing formal data obtained from controlled online learning environments and the social connections and learning experience of students are not analyzed. The expected output for this proposed work is a SNS-integrated Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) named Shelter which provides formal and informal learning for any subject domain area. User testing is conducted and both informal and formal data are stored and elicited from Shelter to investigate the impact of this data combination for more insightful LA results.

AB The fact that different students have different ability levels and learning patterns limit the effectiveness of traditional one-size-fits-all classroom-based teaching. It is difficult to accomplish a learning methodology tailored to individual students in large classes with traditional teaching methods. In this work-in-progress paper, an adaptive learning system, employing a rule-based logic was developed and tested for three undergraduate student courses. The questions were served to students adaptively by the computer, based on their level of understanding. The analytics from the system can act as a feedback to the instructor. Some limitations and practical issues, as well as suggestions for improvement are discussed.

   environment
AB Virtual learning environments are widely used as they simplify and improve the teaching and learning processes. As part of the research project AIX - Future teaching & learning, we want to develop a learning analytics application to evaluate the generated logging data of our learning environment Moodle. The application needs to provide comprehensive statistics and reports to support the teaching and learning processes. The application will allow a variety of complex research questions to be answered which help the lecturers to improve the learning process. Moodle itself offers basic learning analytics functionality, but the logs allow a more detailed analysis of how learners and teachers use the system.
   In this paper, we present how Moodle stores its logging data and explain why the existing data model is not well suited for learning analytics purposes. Therefore, we introduce our own data model and explain how the Moodle logging data can be converted into our format. In addition, we extend the database structure to allow the storing of arbitrary data which can be linked to learners and classes. This flexibility allows storing data from systems other than Moodle, which makes it possible to use meta data like exam grades for learning analytics. We claim that the presented model is well suited for storing the logging data of virtual learning environments and that it provides a good basis for a learning analytics application.

AB The field of learning analytics (LA) has seen a gradual shift from purely data-driven approaches to more holistic views of improving student learning outcomes through data-informed learning design (LD). Despite the growing potential of LA in higher education (HE), the benefits are not yet convincing to the practitioner, in particular aspects of aligning LA data with LD toward desired learning outcomes. This review presents a systematic evaluation of effect sizes reported in 38 key studies in pursuit of effective LA approaches to measuring student learning gain for the enhancement of HE pedagogy and delivery. Large positive effects on student outcomes were found in LDs that fostered socio-collaborative and independent learning skills. Recent trends in personalization of learner feedback identified a need for the integration of student-idiosyncratic factors to improve the student experience and academic outcomes. Finally, key findings are developed into a new three-level framework, the LA Learning Gain Design (LALGD) model, to align meaningful data capture with pedagogical intentions and their learning outcomes. Suitable for various settings - face to face, blended, or fully online - the model contributes to data-informed learning and teaching pedagogies in HE.

AB The effectiveness of using learning analytics for learning design primarily depends upon two concepts: grounding and alignment. This is the primary conjecture for the study described in this paper. In our design-based research study, we design, test, and evaluate teacher-facing learning analytics for an online inquiry science unit on global climate change. We design our learning analytics in accordance with a socioconstructivism-based pedagogical framework, called Knowledge Integration, and the principles of learning analytics Implementation Design. Our methodology for the design process draws upon the principle of the Orchestrating for Learning Analytics framework to engage stakeholders (i.e. teachers, researchers, and developers). The resulting learning analytics were aligned to unit activities that engaged students in key aspects of the knowledge integration process. They provided teachers with actionable insight into their students' understanding at critical junctures in the learning process. We demonstrate the efficacy of the learning analytics in supporting the optimization of the unit's learning design. We conclude by synthesizing the principles that guided our design process into a framework for developing and evaluating learning analytics for learning design.

AB Learning Analytics (LA) and adaptive learning are inextricably linked since they both foster technology-supported learner-centred education. This study identifies developments focusing on their interplay and emphasises insufficiently investigated directions which display a higher innovation potential. Twenty-one peer-reviewed studies are identified via a systematic review and classified based on the dimensions of a proposed framework. The findings of the review suggest that interesting work has been carried out during the last years on the topic. We conclude with a need for more research on the topic in specific learning domains and settings. Recommendations include: a clear strategy for adaptation augmented by LA, the combination of on-task with pre-task measures, and the combination of system-controlled adaptation with user-controlled adaptation. Future trends include the emergence of constructivist-collaborative environments that provide insightful models of complex student behaviour.

AB The use of digital games in education is already a reality, but their use in this area has been hampered by the lack of consolidated resources for evaluation of game-based learning. This paper reports a computational architecture for learning analytics in game-based learning that is based on relational analysis and data mining of data containing evidences of learning collected during the game play. It also uses computer vision techniques applied on images of the players playing to obtain information about their behaviors and emotions during the game.

AB The aim of this paper is to show how multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) can help understand how elementary students explore the concept of feedback loops while controlling an embodied simulation of a predator-prey ecosystem using hand movements as an interface with the computer simulation. We represent student motion patterns from fine-grained logs of hands and gaze data, and then map these observed motion patterns against levels of student performance to make inferences about how embodiment plays a role in the learning process. Results show five distinct motion sequences in students' embodied interactions, and these motion patterns are statistically associated with initial and post-tutorial levels of students' understanding of feedback loops. Analysis of student gaze also shows distinctive patterns as to how low- and high-performing students attended to information presented in the simulation. Using MMLA, we show how students' explanations of feedback loops look differently according to cluster membership, which provides evidence that embodiment interacts with conceptual understanding.

AB Educational games are games explicitly designed with educational purposes and aims to balance learning and playing. These educational games help people to learn and improve as they play. However, there is a lack of gameplay monitoring process whereby the real-time information of game progress is not being reflected. Most of the existing educational games do not consolidate with learning analytics dashboards which leads to no visualization of gameplay information and inadequate gameplay analysis. When players have information on how to improve their performance, they will be encouraged to revisit the game. Hence, an educational game with learning analytics dashboard, ChemistLab, is developed for learners to learn chemistry. The dashboard will visualize the performance and skills changes overtime which reflect the players' learning patterns and strategies used to improve their performance for better learning. The learning content of the game is extracted from the Malaysia Upper Secondary Education (Form 4) Chemistry syllabus. The expected output of the game is to allow users to observe their gameplay performance through the dashboard and gaining new knowledge through the game with the achievement of learning objectives.

AB Educational institutions are evolving away from the one-application-fits- all learning management system to a loosely connected digital learning ecosystem comprising diverse services that increasingly leverage data analytics to drive pedagogical innovation. Yet an ecosystem rich in services but lacking a common approach to measuring learning activity will find data collection, aggregation and analysis time-consuming and costly. The IMS Caliper Analytics (TM) specification addresses the need for data and semantic interoperability by providing an extensible information model, controlled vocabularies and an API for instrumenting learning applications and systems that log learning events. However, many learning activities have yet to be modeled by the Caliper working group. Engaging the SoLAR community directly in this effort will help ensure that the needs of researchers and other consumers of learning analytics data will inform future versions of the specification. The LAK16 Caliper workshop is being offered with this goal in mind. The half-day session, facilitated by members of Team Caliper, will provide LAK16 participants with an opportunity to extend the Caliper specification by modeling new learning activity profiles. New profiles, new connections and new friendships are expected outcomes.

AB We implemented a systematic literature review to investigate the trends and issues of learning analytics in seamless learning environments. We collected and analyzed a total of 27 empirical journal articles that study and discuss learning analytics design and implementation in seamless learning environments. In a recent decade, researchers have explored various seamless learning environments supporting students' inquiry-based and experiential learning. Seamless learning aims to engage students to develop, elaborate, and apply knowledge to various inquiry-based learning contexts. With the significance of formative assessment in digital learning environments, integrating learning analytics into seamless learning environments increasingly evolved to trace and assess student learning. Despite various uses of learning analytics during seamless learning, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews that illustrate how learning analytics has been integrated into seamless learning. This literature synthesis decomposes the collected journal articles to understand learning analytics design and integrations inherent to seamless learning environments. Also, using qualitative thematic analysis, this systematic literature review demonstrates various design practices and future research directions of learning analytics in seamless learning environments.

AB Learning analytics is the measurement, collection, and analysis of data about learners and their contexts for the purposes of understanding and optimizing the process of learning and the underlying environment. Due to the complex nature of the learning process, existing works mostly focus on the modeling and analysis of single learning behavior and thus bears limited capacity in achieving good performance and interpretability of predictive tasks. We propose a research framework for learning analytics based on multilayer behavior fusion which achieves significantly better performance in various tasks including at-risk student prediction. Results of extensive evaluation on thousands of students demonstrate the effectiveness of multilayer behavior fusion. We will report the insights about mining learning behaviors at different layers including physical, social and mental layers from the data collected from multiple sources. We will also describe the quantitative relationships between these behaviors and the students' learning performance.

DE adaptive learning; learning analytics; review
AB In this paper, we consider the key dimensions of learning analytics applications in adaptive learning. We then review recent publications on the topic and map them to the dimensions of the reference model. Twenty one peer-reviewed articles are identified and analyzed. The findings of the review suggest that interesting work has been carried out during the last years on the topic. Yet, there is a clear lack of studies on school education and in topics outside STEM. In addition, there is a lack of studies that do not focus solely on the (self)reflection of students or tutors. Finally, the majority of the studies included look at student performance, as an adaptation parameter. Yet, a new trend of taking into account more complex student behaviors, like collaboration, is emerging.

ID ACHIEVEMENT; MODEL
AB Studies in the field of learning analytics (LA) have shown students' demographics and learning management system (LMS) data to be effective identifiers of "at risk" performance. However, insights generated by these predictive models may not be suitable for pedagogically informed interventions due to the inability to explain why students display these behavioral patterns. Therefore, this study aims at providing explanations of students' behaviors on LMS by incorporating dispositional dimensions (e.g., self-regulation and emotions) into conventional learning analytics models. Using a combination of demographic, trace, and self-reported data of eight contemporary social-cognitive theories of education from 1,069 students in a blended introductory quantitative course, we demonstrate the potential of dispositional characteristics of students, such as procrastination and boredom. Our results highlight the need to move beyond simple engagement metrics, whereby dispositional learning analytics provide an actionable bridge between learning analytics and educational intervention.

AB Educational institutions are designing, creating and evaluating courses to optimize learning outcomes for highly diverse student populations. Yet, most of the delivery is still monitored retrospectively with summative evaluation forms. Therefore, improvements to the course design are only implemented at the very end of a course, thus missing to benefit the current cohort. Teachers find it difficult to interpret and plan interventions just-in-time. In this context, Learning Analytics (LA) data streams gathered from 'authentic' student learning activities, may provide new opportunities to receive valuable information on the students' learning behaviors and could be utilized to adjust the learning design already "on the fly" during runtime. We presume that Learning Analytics applied within Learning Design (LD) and presented in a learning dashboard provide opportunities that can lead to more personalized learning experiences, if implemented thoughtfully.
   In this paper, we describe opportunities and challenges for using LA in LD. We identify three key opportunities for using LA in LD: (O1) using on demand indicators for evidence based decisions on learning design; (O2) intervening during the run-time of a course; and, (O3) increasing student learning outcomes and satisfaction. In order to benefit from these opportunities, several challenges have to be overcome. Following a thorough literature review, we mapped the identified opportunities and challenges in a conceptual model that considers the interaction of LA in LD.

AB Given the significance that technology-enhanced learning (TEL) receives in learning analytics, this study presents a neural deep learning architecture aimed to enhance a smart environment of a digital humanities laboratory. Presented a humanistic subject/controversy, the students interacted by producing multi-modal data (text, images, sound, movement) captured and processed with programmed devices. The smart environment induces emotional states during students' interactions and tasks in various scenarios, capturing images and facial expressions to classify student emotions. This study set up a preliminary experiment, testing the learning analytics model to show how it works and what outputs could be obtained. Leveraging the benefits of non-contact sensor technology, affective computing, and artificial intelligence, we collected biometric and neurocognitive data to establish correlations in the learning production of students studying humanistic and artistic topics. Despite the extended opinion expressed in the literature that the humanities do not have solid references on which to base learning analytics, this study shows that much quantitative data is available in such resources.

AB Serious games adoption is increasing, although their penetration in formal education is still surprisingly low. To improve their outcomes and increase their adoption in this domain, we propose new ways in which serious games can leverage the information extracted from player interactions, beyond the usual post-activity analysis. We focus on the use of: (1) open data which can be shared for research purposes, (2) real-time feedback for teachers that apply games in schools, to maintain awareness and control of their classroom, and (3) once enough data is gathered, data mining to improve game design, evaluation and deployment; and allow teachers and students to benefit from enhanced feedback or stealth assessment. Having developed and tested a game learning analytics platform throughout multiple experiments, we describe the lessons that we have learnt when analyzing learning analytics data in the previous contexts to improve serious games.

AB With the development of blended learning, it has been widely applied in teaching process. However, in the context of blended learning, tutor are not easy to acquire learning process of students and to make good use of learner' behaviors records. Therefore, they cannot timely receive feedback and effectively perform evaluation based on traditional indicators and method. To address this problem, this paper applies learning analytics and studies the learning behavior records in blended learning, i.e., integrating learning analytics to construct an evaluation mode through the evaluation theory, types, subject, and applies the mode to the specific teaching practice. This can provide guidance for tutors and help them make better effective and objective evaluation.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB The application of learning analytics (LA) to research and practice in higher education is expanding. Researchers and practitioners are using LA to provide an evidentiary basis across higher education to investigate student learning, to drive institutional quality improvement strategies, to determine at-risk behaviours and develop intervention strategies, to measure attrition more effectively and to improve curriculum design and evaluation in both on-campus and e-learning settings. This paper is a case study report of the novel application of LA to programme curriculum review from a major cross-institutional project in Hong Kong. The paper describes the rationale for the project, the conceptual model that led the approach and the development of a software tool that allowed the automation of statistical analyses specifically relevant to programme review. In addition, the paper addresses a major challenge that the project faced in relation to data governance. The paper concludes by proposing the potential benefits of LA for programme curriculum review.

TI Integrating multiple data sources for learning analytics-review of
   literature
SO RESEARCH AND PRACTICE IN TECHNOLOGY ENHANCED LEARNING
LA English

DE Learning analytics; Higher education; Data integration; Multiple data
   sources; Interoperability; Scalability
AB Learning analytics (LA) promises understanding and optimization of learning and learning environments. To enable richer insights regarding questions related to learning and education, LA solutions should be able to integrate data coming from many different data sources, which may be stored in different formats and have varying levels of structure. Data integration also plays a role for the scalability of LA, an important challenge in itself. The objective of this review is to assess the current state of LA in terms of data integration in the context of higher education. The initial search of six academic databases and common venues for publishing LA research resulted in 115 publications, out of which 20 were included in the final analysis. The results show that a few data sources (e.g., LMS) appear repeatedly in the research studies; the number of data sources used in LA studies in higher education tends to be limited; when data are integrated, similar data formats are often combined (a low-hanging fruit in terms of technical challenges); the research literature tends to lack details about data integration in the implemented systems; and, despite being a good starting point for data integration, educational data specifications (e.g., xAPI) seem to seldom be used. In addition, the results indicate a lack of stakeholder (e.g., teachers/instructors, technology vendors) involvement in the research studies. The review concludes by offering recommendations to address limitations and gaps in the research reported in the literature.

AB This paper addresses the implications of combining learning analytics and serious games for improving game quality, monitoring and assessment of player behavior, gaming performance, game progression, learning goals achievement, and user's appreciation. We introduce two modes of serious games analytics: in-game (real time) analytics, and post-game (off-line) analytics. We also explain the GLEANER framework for in-game analytics and describe a practical example for off-line analytics. We conclude with a brief outlook on future work, highlighting opportunities and challenges towards a solid uptake of SGs in authentic educational and training settings.

AB This study was designed to identify correlations between students' awareness of Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) and learning performance and learning behavior in science education. The topic of the course was Genetic Diseases which was implemented in a twelfth-grade class. To assess the effectiveness of this instructional design, and to find out potential factors that affect the using of CPS skills, multiple data sources including learning test scores, questionnaire feedback, and learning logs were analyzed. First, results indicated significant improvements in students' knowledge acquisition and awareness of Participation and Learning and Knowledge Building in CPS during the course. Furthermore, when we investigated the correlations between CPS awareness and learning performance and learning behavior, the findings indicated significant positive correlations between students' learning motivation and their awareness of CPS processes. However, there were negative correlations found between certain learning behavior factors with CPS awareness and learning motivation factors respectively.

ID REMOTE; LABORATORIES; EDUCATION
AB learning environments, such as online laboratories offer many opportunities for collecting data for Learning Analytics (LA). This article presents a systematic literature review for LA in laboratory based learning environments for Higher Engineering Education, which yielded 23 key references. The focus of the study was formed by the following research questions (RQ): What types of data are currently collected in online laboratories (RQ 1)? How is LA used to support learning and teaching processes as well as the design of the online-laboratory environment (RQ 2)? What design recommendations for the use of LA in laboratory-based learning environments can be derived (RQ 3)? The gained results show that LA can be used to provide feedback for simple as well as for complex learning processes in online laboratories. Moreover, it assists data-informed decision making for teaching and learning processes as well as for the design of the lab environment. Implications for future research projects were derived based on the findings and should contribute to the advancement of research on LA in online laboratories.

AB The wish for a more engaging e-learning design and better utilization of the technology at hand has led to the pedagogic design in this study. We wanted to make a strong alternative to face-to-face teaching that was just as likely to facilitate learning as face to face teacher presentations and class discussions. The study investigates how online discussions in connection with teacher produced video presentations can generate an `open source learning stream' in an e-learning course for teachers. We look at how an `open source learning stream' can encourage students to give and receive peer feedback. We propose the idea that if learning in an online community is set up to follow the lines of identity building in social media (Larsen 2007) then we might get a natural momentum in the `open source learning stream'. We try to identify demographic factors that could influence the success of the 'open source learning stream'. We found that some students in the demographic group that used computers in their childhood experience that they can learn more form video clips and online discussion than from traditional teacher presentations and face to face discussions. We also found that the demographic group that didn't use computers in their childhood believes that they learn more for traditional face-to-face teaching. This divergence in belief calls for a better defined demographic categorization of the students before dividing them into groups in e-learning. The categorization might assist the diffusion of innovation in the persuasion stage (Rogers 2010) of the implementation of the new pedagogic design so that peers would persuade each other that they can adopt the new learning practices and participate in the 'open source learning stream'. We propose the idea that significant demographic knowledge of the students in combination with learning analytics can generate a strong e-learning design. Furthermore we investigate inclusion/exclusion mechanisms in the pedagogic design and we found that a more rapid and multimodal type of reply would help some students. The study presents a critical realist analysis of the pedagogic design in question and tries to abduct a categorization of student demographics' influence on learning progression and on the utilization of web-tools at hand in the students' learning process.

DE learning analytics dashboards; visualisation; interaction; evaluation
AB Learning analytics dashboards are at the core of the LAK vision to involve the human into the decision-making process. The key focus of these dashboards is to support better human sense-making and decision-making by visualising data about learners to a variety of stakeholders. Early research on learning analytics dashboards focused on the use of visualisation and prediction techniques and demonstrates the rich potential of dashboards in a variety of learning settings. Present research increasingly uses participatory design methods to tailor dashboards to the needs of stakeholders, employs multimodal data acquisition techniques, and starts to research theoretical underpinnings of dashboards. In this paper, we present these past and present research efforts as well as the results of the VISLA19 workshop on "Visual approaches to Learning Analytics" that was held at LAK19 with experts in the domain to identify and articulate common practices and challenges for the domain. Based on an analysis of the results, we present a research agenda to help shape the future of learning analytics dashboards.

AB Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics (LA) focus on data analysis of learners in the context of educational settings like Moodle, a Learning Management System (LMS). Both EDM and LA aim to understand learners and optimise learning processes. Predictive modelling serve a key role in optimising learning processes. Learning Analytics in an LMS covers many different aspects: finding students at risk of abandoning a course, predicting students failing a quiz or students not reaching the end of a lesson in less than 15 minutes. Thus, there are multiple prediction models that can be explored. The prediction models can target at the course also. For instance, will this course engage learners? Will this forum be useful to the students of this course? To ease the evaluation and usage of Supervised Learning prediction models in LMS, we abstract the key elements of prediction models and we build an analytics framework for Moodle, one of the most popular Learning management Systems available in the market. Our software framework manages the complete cycle that predictive models follow until they are used in production, which includes calculations of features and labels from the LMS database raw data, normalization, feature engineering, model evaluation and a production-ready mode to generate insights for users from predictions. Apart from the software framework we also present a use case that serves as an example: A prediction model which is able to identify students at risk of abandoning a course with a 92% in accuracy using past versions of the course as training data.

AB Since its inception in 2011, Learning Analytics has matured and expanded in terms of reach (e.g., primary and K-12 education) and in having access to a greater variety, volume and velocity of data (e.g. collecting and analyzing multimodal data). Its roots in multiple disciplines yield a range and richness of theoretical influences resulting in an inherent theoretical pluralism. Such multi-and interdisciplinary origins and influences raise questions around which learning theories inform learning analytics research, and the implications for the field should a particular theory dominate. In establishing the theoretical influences in learning analytics, this scoping review focused on the Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference (LAK) Proceedings (2011-2020) and the Journal of Learning Analytics (JLA) (2014-2020) as data sources. While learning analytics research is published across a range of scholarly journals, at the time of this study, a significant part of research into learning analytics had been published under the auspices of the Society of Learning Analytics (SoLAR), in the proceedings of the annual LAK conference and the field's official journal, and as such, provides particular insight into its theoretical underpinnings. The analysis found evidence of a range of theoretical influences. While some learning theories have waned since 2011, others, such as Self-Regulated Learning (SRL), are in the ascendency. We discuss the implications of the use of learning theory in learning analytics research and conclude that this theoretical pluralism is something to be treasured and protected.

AB Language education has a rich history of research and scholarship focusing on the effectiveness of learning activities and the impact these have on student behaviour and outcomes. One of the basic assumptions in foreign language pedagogy and CALL in particular is that learners want to be able to communicate effectively with native speakers of their chosen language. Combining principles of learning analytics and Big Data with learning design, this study used a student activity based taxonomy adopted by the Open University UK to inform module design. The learning designs of four introductory and intermediary language education modules and online engagement of 2111 learners were contrasted using weekly learning design data. In this study, we aimed to explore how learning design decisions made by language teachers influenced students' engagement in the VLE. Using fixed effect models, our findings indicated that 55% of variance of weekly online engagement in these four modules was explained by the way language teachers designed weekly learning design activities. Our learning analytics study highlights the potential affordances for CALL researchers to use the power of learning design and big data to explore and understand the complexities and dynamics of language learning for students and teachers.

AB E-learning environments are still characterized by lack of advanced tools for increasing student engagement. Concepts of supporting engagement and motivation of students in e-learning environments are still being discussed in research community. The concept of gamification is providing certain components (points, rankings, levels, etc.), however, its effective embedment within learning management systems is still remaining a challenge.
   The first step towards such automated system could be modelling tool, delivering instant feedback not only to the student, but also to the teacher and the academia about the engagement within a course.
   The article will share thoughts related to the approach of modelling student engagement in an e-learning environment (moodle). Analysis of data about learners and their activity within e-learning environment (learning analytics) will provide basis for this modelling. We gathered data from a gamified course (more than 50 000 log data, more than n = 79 users) and suggest using of a modelling approach for measuring effectiveness of different gamification components within an e-learning environment.
   The aim of the article is to provide deeper insight into specific aspects of engagement within e-learning environments.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the factors that might affect learning performance and collaborative problem solving (CPS) awareness in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. We collected and analyzed data on important factors in STEM education, including learning strategy and learning behaviors, and examined their interrelationships with learning performance and CPS awareness, respectively. Multiple data sources, including learning tests, questionnaire feedback, and learning logs, were collected and examined following a learning analytics approach. Significant positive correlations were found for the learning behavior of using markers with learning performance and CPS awareness in group discussion, while significant negative correlations were found for some factors of STEM learning strategy and learning behaviors in pre-learning with some factors of CPS awareness. The results imply the importance of an efficient approach to using learning strategies and functional tools in STEM education.

AB This paper explores the potential of analytics for improving accessibility of e-learning and supporting disabled learners in their studies. A comparative analysis of completion rates of disabled and non-disabled students in a large five-year dataset is presented and a wide variation in comparative retention rates is characterized. Learning analytics enable us to identify and understand such discrepancies and, in future, could be used to focus interventions to improve retention of disabled students. An agenda for onward research, focused on Critical Learning Paths, is outlined. This paper is intended to stimulate a wider interest in the potential benefits of learning analytics for institutions as they try to assure the accessibility of their e-learning and provision of support for disabled students.

AB The importance of learning design in education is widely acknowledged in the literature. Should learners make effective use of opportunities provided in a learning design, especially in online environments, previous studies have shown that they need to have strong skills for self-regulated learning (SRL). The literature, which reports the use of learning analytics (LA), shows that SRL skills are best exhibited in choices of learning tactics that are reflective of metacognitive control and monitoring. However, in spite of high significance for evaluation of learning experience, the link between learning design and learning tactics has been under-explored. In order to fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel learning analytic method that combines three data analytic techniques, including a cluster analysis, a process mining technique, and an epistemic network analysis. The proposed method was applied to a dataset collected in a massive open online course (MOOC) on teaching in flipped classrooms which was offered on a Chinese MOOC platform to pre- and in-service teachers. The results showed that the application of the approach detected four learning tactics (Search oriented, Content and assessment oriented, Content oriented and Assessment oriented) which were used by MOOC learners. The analysis of tactics' usage across learning sessions revealed that learners from different performance groups had different priorities. The study also showed that learning tactics shaped by instructional cues were embedded in different units of study in MOOC. The learners from a high-performance group showed a high level of regulation through strong alignment of the choices of learning tactics with tasks provided in the learning design. The paper also provides a discussion about implications of research and practice.

AB Learning analytics, as a rapidly evolving field, offers an encouraging approach with the aim of understanding, optimizing and enhancing learning process. Learners have the capabilities to interact with the learning analytics system through adequate user interface. Such systems enables various features such as learning recommendations, visualizations, reminders, rating and self-assessments possibilities. This paper proposes a framework for learning analytics aimed to improve personalized learning environments, encouraging the learner's skills to monitor, adapt, and improve their own learning. It is an attempt to articulate the characterizing properties that reveals the association between learning analytics and personalized learning environment. In order to verify data analysis approaches and to determine the validity and accuracy of a learning analytics, and its corresponding to learning profiles, a case study was performed. The findings indicate that educational data for learning analytics are context specific and variables carry different meanings and can have different implications on learning success prediction.

AB Policy for learning analytics joins a stream of initiatives aimed at understanding the expanding world of information collection, storage, processing and dissemination that is being driven by computing technologies. This paper offers a information policy perspective on learning analytics, joining work by others on ethics and privacy in the management of learning analytics data [8], but extending to consider how issues play out across the information lifecycle and in the formation of policy. Drawing on principles from information policy both informs learning analytics and brings learning analytics into the information policy domain. The resulting combination can help inform policy development for educational institutions as they implement and manage learning analytics policy and practices. The paper begins with a brief summary of the information policy perspective, then addresses learning analytics with attention to various categories of consideration for policy development.

ID PRIVACY PRINCIPLES; OPPORTUNITIES
AB In a context where learning mediated by technology has gained prominence in higher education, learning analytics has become a powerful tool to collect and analyse data with the aim of improving students' learning. However, learning analytics is part of a young community and its developments deserve further exploration. Some critical stances claim that learning analytics tends to underplay the complexity of teaching-learning processes. By means of both a bibliometric and a content analysis, this paper examines the publication patterns on learning analytics in higher education and their main challenges. 385 papers that were published in WoScc and SciELO indexes between 2013 and 2019 were identified and analysed. Learning analytics is a vibrant and fast-developing community. However, it continues to face multiple and complex challenges, especially regarding students' learning and their implications. The paper concludes by distinguishing between a practice-based and management-oriented community of learning analytics and an academic-oriented community. Within both communities, though, it seems that the focus is more on analytics than on learning.

AB This Research Full Paper implements a framework that harness sources of programming learning analytics on three computer programming courses a Higher Education Institution. The platform, called PredictCS, automatically detects lower-performing or "at-risk" students in programming courses and automatically and adaptively sends them feedback. This system has been progressively adopted at the classroom level to improve personalized learning. A visual analytics dashboard is developed and accessible to Faculty. This contains information about the models deployed and insights extracted from student's data. By leveraging historical student data we built predictive models using student characteristics, prior academic history, logged interactions between students and online resources, and students' progress in programming laboratory work. Predictions were generated every week during the semester's classes. In addition, during the second half of the semester, students who opted-in received pseudo real-time personalised feedback. Notifications were personalised based on students' predicted performance on the course and included a programming suggestion from a top-student in the class if any programs submitted had failed to meet the specified criteria. As a result, this helped students who corrected their programs to learn more and reduced the gap between lower and higher-performing students.

AB The use of analytical methods from learning analytics (LA) research combined with visualizations of learning activities using learning design (LD) tools and frameworks has provided important insight into how instructors design for learning. Nonetheless, there are many subtle nuances in instructors' design decisions that might not easily be captured using LA tools. Therefore, this study sets out to explore how and why instructors design for learning in an online and distance higher education setting by employing a mixed-method approach, which combined semi-structured interviews of 12 instructors with network analyses of their LDs. Our findings uncovered several underlying factors that influenced how instructors designed their modules and highlighted some discrepancies between instructors' pedagogical beliefs and their actual LD as captured by the Open University Learning Design Initiative (OULDI). This study showcases the potential of combining LA with qualitative insights for a better understanding of the complex design process in online distance higher education.

AB In South Africa, less than half of Grade 12 learners study Maths. Of these, barely half achieve above 30% for Maths. Global assessments such as TIMMS expose South Africa's problems in Maths at Grade 8 and Grade 4 levels. Poor performance and denied access to Maths and Science are a national problem. Learners acquire learning deficits - an absence of learning and a lack of remedial attention - due to socio-economic conditions and a poorly functioning educational system. Reflective Learning delivers diagnostics providing a complete audit of a learner's Maths knowledge from Grade 1 to Grade 9. Reflective Learning produces a personalised blueprint with detailed and explicit feedback addressing specific learning deficits acquired from past learning experiences for each learner. Diagnostics measure performance on seven conceptual threads running through Maths from Grade 1 to 9. Eighty-one conceptual landmarks along these threads are benchmarked at Grade 3, Grade 6 and Grade 9 levels to collect evidence of the occurrence and extent of each learner's difficulties in Maths. Results support an assessment as learning approach which enables teacher and learner to track back to rebuild understanding from each learner's last secure place within the conceptual thread so as to fast-track mastery of the basics of Mathematics. Reflective Learning diagnostics are deployed online via computer, tablet or mobile phone. Each learner receives a unique log-in code to complete the tests. Cohort data is collected and analysed immediately after completion. Teachers log-in to access individual learner reports and download cohort analytics to facilitate intervention design based on their learners' specific needs. In research and development of the Reflective Learning diagnostics, fifty Grade 10 learners in Mpumalanga, who were identified as all performing below Grade 6 level in Maths on the diagnostics, underwent an assessment as learning intervention, enabling metacognitive activation to fast-track learning and catch up learning deficits. Learners more than doubled their performance in just two terms after only one-hour a week contact time after following an assessment as learning approach using the conceptual threads design enabled by the diagnostic blueprint reports. Lessons learned from the research study were: if acquired learning deficits from early grades are not addressed, learners' progress is blocked; that acquired learning deficits in Maths are not insurmountable and can be overcome using an assessment as learning - conceptual thread approach; that learners can catch up between three to six grade-levels within a one year period using this approach; and that Grade 10 is not too late to fix learning deficits as long as these can be pinpointed for remediation. Through the use of technology, the diagnostic has been delivered countrywide even to remote areas. Disadvantaged schools lacking resources can make use of a mobile testing unit and costs are subsidised by independent and well-resourced schools. Teachers are able to access instantly generated data to utilise for targeted remediation empowering meaningful data-driven practice in their classrooms.

AB This article serves as a reflection on the papers accepted for this special issue. Although 2011 saw the first learning analytics conference, the field draws from a long history of research in associated disciplines such as psychology, statistics, education and computer science. However, the novelty of learning analytics research stems from the access and analysis of large, yet granular, data sources that are generated from student interactions in online activities. The vast array and volume of accessible learning data have promulgated new approaches to understanding and measuring learning. As researchers pursue such algorithmically generated insights, there are parallel challenges to individual ethics and privacy and a broader consideration of the impact of an increased quantification of education. This special issue on the role of learning analytics in open, flexible, and distance learning (OFDL) environments aims to bring alternate perspectives to bear on how such analyses are improving learning while still addressing social and cultural challenges.

AB In higher education, learning analytics is trending for transforming teaching behavior, uncovering information on the human learning process, understanding factors for smart learning environments, and addressing artificial intelligence issues in education. During the last decade, learning analytics has been practiced in many educational institutions worldwide, resulting in many success stories. This paper is based on a pre-selected 49 articles published in the last decade where learning management systems and smart learning environments are used to collect data and analyze using data-driven methods to support learning analytics principles. However, an emphasis is given to 15 articles found between 2017 to 2020 in Asia, North and South America, the UK, and European higher educational contexts as JISC 2017 report briefed on the earlier practices. The findings from the 15 international practices are discussed and visualized using the geo-visualization method.

AB Many universities choose the C programming language (C) as the first one they teach their students, early on in their program. However, students often consider programming courses difficult, and these courses often have among the highest dropout rates of computer science courses offered. It is therefore critical to provide more effective instruction to help students understand the syntax of C and prevent them losing interest in programming. In addition, homework and paper-based exams are still the main assessment methods in the majority of classrooms. It is difficult for teachers to grasp students' learning situation due to the large amount of evaluation work. To facilitate teaching and learning of C, in this article we propose a system-LAPLE (Learning Analytics in Programming Language Education)-that provides a learning dashboard to capture the behavior of students in the classroom and identify the different difficulties faced by different students looking at different knowledge. With LAPLE, teachers may better grasp students' learning situation in real time and better improve educational materials using analysis results. For their part, novice undergraduate programmers may use LAPLE to locate syntax errors in C and get recommendations from educational materials on how to fix them.

AB The information and Communication Technologies changes how we interact with others and with the information. It can be really accessed at anytime and anywhere. Future professionals should be ready for this reality which requires changes in traditional teaching and learning methods. Challenge Based Learning is an example of them. This method poses challenges to students that they should solve employing the technology they use during their daily life. The evaluation of challenges solutions should take into account students' final outcomes but also the interactions that take place between them. This could be very hard given the wide choice of tools that students can apply. Learning analytics tools could be a solution.
   This paper reviews and classifies the tools applied in several Challenge Based Learning experiments and describes different possibilities to apply Learning Analytics. From this research, it is possible to conclude that Learning Analytics can be applied in Challenge Based Learning contexts, but it is desirable to use a single platform to group the tools employed to solve the challenge.

AB Learning management systems are often seen as enablers for learning analytics as they generate data and help to analyse such data. In the case of the popular learning management system Moodie, however, almost no learning analytics functionalities are provided.
   In this report, a method will be demonstrated how learning materials can be integrated into Moodie courses so that they produce interaction data. Such data can be collected and used as input for learning analytics.

AB Various types of learners can be observed in today's e-learning environments. Using some of the existing models for the learner type classification, like Felder-Silverman Learning Styles Model (FSLSM), we can identify learners' preferences and needs and use them to adjust the environment. On the other hand, Learning Analytics can offer insights on a student's engagement and behaviour, by tracking their actions and performance. We can correlate this data with the data on learners' type, and use it for deeper user modelling. Supported by visualizations on learning styles and learning behaviour, students and instructors can reflect the learning process. Based on our previously published conceptual model for linking learning analytics and learning styles in e-learning environments, we present an Integrated Learning Styles Analytics system (ILSA), which supports identification of learning styles as well as analysis and visualization of activity data in the Moodle LMS. ILSA consists of a questionnaire for learning style identification derived from FSLSM and offers immediate results to its participants. Next, by utilizing various data sources in Moodle, e.g. log data or the grade book, we are able to correlate a user's activity and performance with their learning styles. This work offers details on the finalized concept as well as its implementation. By providing insights on data sources in Moodle and presenting various visualizations, this work allows teachers to reuse the system in their e-learning courses.

DE Collaborative Learning; Virtual Mobility; Social Learning Analytics;
   Learning Analytics Dashboard
AB The ability to work collaboratively in intercultural virtual teams, is constantly gaining importance for the labour market. Virtual Mobility enables students to acquire the necessary intercultural teamwork skills while remaining locally integrated into their regular studies. But still, international virtual collaborative learning scenarios demand much time and effort for planning and coordination which binds resources. The support concepts for such collaborative virtual learning groups are also resource-intensive, because learners should be accompanied by qualified e-tutors to optimise learning results both at individual and group level. Classical summative tests and exams are rather unsuitable for the assessment of collaboration as expected learning outcome. These arrangements also need new formative assessment forms, as participants need active and ongoing feedback. A meaningful assessment of learning processes and outcomes should not only be based on the observation of 'soft' factors but should also be complemented by 'hard', fixed, automatically measurable, quantitative indicators. To gain these hard indicators the research project ISLA - Indicator-based Social Learning Analytics was launched. This paper presents the procedure for implementation as well as virtual presence, content creation and relationships within the community as first derived indicators and their prototypical visualisation in a Learning Analytics Dashboard.

AB Learning analytics (LA) mines, analyzes and visualizes the data of students' learning behaviours on learning platforms such as Learning Management Systems (LMS), but few LA tools built are adaptable to multiple platforms or for general education courses. This study sets out to evaluate a lightweight LA tool implemented on Moodle and Open edX for monitoring students' learning progress. Survey data were collected from 156 students, supplemented by interview responses from 25 students and three instructors. Preliminary results show that a considerable portion of surveyed students used the LA tool and they held positive opinions on its efficacy in monitoring self-progress and the effectiveness of its visualizations for information delivery. Nonetheless, learners who did not use the LA tool raised concerns about it relying only on their online behaviours without considering their offline learning. Coupled with instructors' evaluation results, discussion and implications are presented.

AB How learning disposition data can help us translating learning feedback from a learning analytics application into actionable learning interventions, is the main focus of this empirical study. It extends previous work (Tempelaar, Rienties, & Giesbers, 2015), where the focus was on deriving timely prediction models in a data rich context, encompassing trace data from learning management systems, formative assessment data, e-tutorial trace data as well as learning dispositions. In this same educational context, the current study investigates how the application of cluster analysis based on e-tutorial trace data allows student profiling into different at-risk groups, and how these at-risk groups can be characterized with the help of learning disposition data. It is our conjecture that establishing a chain of antecedent consequence relationships starting from learning disposition, through student activity in e-tutorials and formative assessment performance, to course performance, adds a crucial dimension to current learning analytics studies: that of profiling students with descriptors that easily lend themselves to the design of educational interventions.

AB A common problem when trying to apply data mining techniques to improve educational systems is the disconnection between those who have the expertise (e.g. universities) and those who have access to the data (e.g. small companies). Bringing expertise into educational in-production systems is complicated because companies are reluctant to invest a lot of effort into integrating new technology that they do not fully trust, while the technology cannot prove its worth without access to real, valid data. In this paper we explore the requirements that machine learning systems have to be applied to specific learning problems (sequencing and performance prediction), and then propose a minimally invasive protocol for sequencing (based on web services) to easily integrate Learning Analytics Services into e-learning systems.

AB The Learning Analytics (LA) discipline analyzes educational data obtained from student interaction with online resources. Most of the data is collected from Learning Management Systems deployed at established educational institutions. In addition, other learning platforms, most notably Massive Open Online Courses such as Udacity and Coursera or other educational initiatives such as Khan Academy, generate large amounts of data. However, there is no generally agreed-upon data model for student interactions. Thus, analysis tools must be tailored to each system's particular data structure, reducing their interoperability and increasing development costs. Some e-Learning standards designed for content interoperability include data models for gathering student performance information. In this paper, we describe how well-known LA tools collect data, which we link to how two e-Learning standards - IEEE Standard for Learning Technology and Experience API - define their data models. From this analysis, we identify the advantages of using these e-Learning standards from the point of view of Learning Analytics.

AB In online learning, teachers need constant feedback about their students' progress and regulation needs. Learning Analytics Dashboards for process-oriented feedback can be a valuable tool for this purpose. However, few such dashboards have been proposed in literature, and most of them lack empirical validation or grounding in learning theories. We present a teacher-facing dashboard for process-oriented feedback in online learning, co-designed and evaluated through an iterative design process involving teachers and visualization experts. We also reflect on our design process by discussing the challenges, pitfalls, and successful strategies for building this type of dashboard.

AB Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) aims to support evidence-based educational practices by collecting, processing, analyzing and sense-making of multimodal evidence of learning. MMLA is not widespread yet and there are few tailored MMLA solutions to meet the requirements of a specific learning scenario. This PhD project investigates the main challenges behind the limited development of MMLA solutions and proposes an MMLA infrastructure as the main contribution. The proposed infrastructure includes three components - a data value chain, a data model and a software architecture. The overall project follows the design-based research methodology where multiple iterations are involved to refine the contributions.

AB Learning vocabulary is a crucial but challenging activity for English as a foreign language learners, and computer-assisted language learning can facilitate this process. Moreover, elearning is attracting a great deal of attention as a new technology to bring educational support which traditional learning systems cannot provide. Recommender systems as its implementation have been subject to discussion. In this study, we propose a comprehensive learning analytics-based platform for efficient vocabulary learning, including an e-book reader and a book/quiz recommender. The system on this platform estimates learners' knowledge based on their activities and brings personalized recommendation and its bases to the learners. Also, this platform provides teachers with visualized feedback regarding the recommendation and students' engagement in learning.

AB Learning activities are at the core of every educational design effort. Designing learning activities is a process that benefits from reflecting on previous runs of those activities. One way to measure the behaviour and effects of design choices is to use learning analytics (LA). The challenge, however, lies in the unavailability of an easy-to-use, LA-supported learning design (LD) method. We established such a method-the Fellowship of Learning Activities and Analytics (FoLA2)-reinforced by a gameboard and cards, to provide structure and inspiration. The method enables several participants with different roles to interact with a set of card decks to collaboratively create an LA-supported LD. Using this method helps to design learning activities in a collaborative, practical way; it also raises awareness about the benefits of multidisciplinary co-design and connections between LA and LD. FoLA2 can be used to develop, capture, and systematize design elements and to systematically incorporate LA.

AB Involving teachers in the design of technology-enhanced learning environments is a useful method towards bridging the gap between research and practice. This is especially relevant for learning analytics tools, wherein the presentation of educational data to teachers or students requires meaningful sense-making to effectively support data-driven actions. In this paper, we present two case studies carried out in the context of two research projects in the USA and Spain which aimed to involve teachers in the co-design of learning analytics tools through professional development programs. The results of a cross-case analysis highlight lessons learned around challenges and principles regarding the meaningful involvement of teachers in learning analytics tooling design.

AB In this article we report on the findings of a project funded by the Australian Office for Learning and Teaching and entitled "Learning Analytics: Assisting Universities with Student Retention." While this project was primarily focused on retention as a potential outcome of learning analytics, its application could be related to the broader concept of student success. Student success allows for a focus on pedagogy and the use of learning analytics for the improvement of learning and teaching with a firm scholarly evidence base. The data gathered for the project provide the background for a discussion about the potential of learning analytics to inform the practice of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. A case study demonstrates the potential of this approach. Overall, clear pedagogical questions are important in the application of learning analytics to the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, and we suggest potential ways to explore pedagogical questions with big data methods.

AB As learning analytics activity has increased, a variety of ethical implications and considerations have emerged, though a significant research gap remains in explicitly investigating the views of key stakeholders, such as academic staff. This paper draws on ethics-related findings from an Australian study featuring two surveys, one of institutional leaders (n = 22) and one of academic staff (n = 353), as well as a set of follow-up interviews (n = 23) with academic level staff. A self-selecting sample of participants was asked about the ethical issues they see as important in learning analytics and about the types of ethical principles or considerations they thought should guide learning analytics use. Data showed participants' views did tend to align with established ethical principles, though the language used to express this varied widely. Building on, and in response to, both the data and the literature review the paper proposes an ethical decision making framework that encourages institutional leaders and those involved in implementing learning analytics to consistently apply and document ethical decision making processes as part of an overall approach to developing well-aligned and transparent institutional policies and broader ethical literacy.

AB This paper presents an analysis of learning analytics practices which aimed to achieve personalised learning. It addresses the need for a systematic analysis of the increasing amount of practices of learning analytics which are targeted at personalised learning. The paper summarises and highlights the characteristics and trends in relevant learning analytics practices, and illustrates their relationship with personalised learning. The analysis covers 144 related articles published between 2012 and 2019 collected from Scopus. The learning analytics practices were analysed from the dimensions of what (learning context, learning environment, and data collected), who (stakeholder), why (objective of learning analytics, and personalised learning goal), and how (learning analytics method), as well as their outcomes and limitations. The results show the diversified contexts of learning analytics, with the major ones being tertiary education and online learning. The types of data for learning analytics, which have been increasingly collected from online and emerging learning environments, are mainly related to the learning activities, academic performance, educational background and learning outcomes. The most frequent types of learning analytics objectives and personalised learning goals are enhancing learning experience, providing personal recommendations and satisfying personal learning needs. The learning analytics methods have commonly involved the use of statistical tests, classification, clustering and visualisation techniques. The findings also suggest the areas for future work to address the limitations revealed in the practices, such as investigating more cost-effective ways of offering personalised support, and the transforming role of teachers in personalised learning practices.

AB Learning Analytics is a melting pot for a multitude of research fields and origin of many developments about learning and its environment. There is a serious hype over the concepts of learning analytics, however, concrete solutions and applications are comparably scarce. Of course, data rich environments, such as MOOCs, come with statistical analytics dashboards, although the educational value is often limited. Practical solutions for scenarios in data-lean environments or for small-scale organizations are rarely adopted. The LA4S project is dedicated to gather practical solutions, provide a tool box for practitioners, and publish a cook book with concrete learning analytics recipes for everyone.

AB Seamless learning has been recognized as an effective learning approach across various dimensions including formal and informal learning contexts, individual and social learning, and physical world and cyberspace. With the emergence of seamless learning, majority of the current research focus on realizing a seamless learning environment at school or university. However, the utilization of the collected learning logs still remains a challenge yet to be explored. In this study, an e-book with ubiquitous learning system called SCROLL is developed to collect and analyze learning logs in the seamless learning environment. Moreover, this paper presents our analytics in contribution to bridging the learning between eBook learning and real-life learning. An experiment was conducted to evaluate (1) whether VASCORLL 2.0 (Visualization and Analysis System for Connecting Relationships of Learning Logs) is effective in connecting the words learned through eBook to those learned from real-life, and (2) which social network centrality is the most effective to enhance learning in the seamless learning environment. Twenty international students participated in the evaluation experiment, and they were able to increase their learning opportunities by using VASCORLL 2.0. Furthermore, the betweenness centrality was found useful in finding central words that bridge eBook and real-life learning.

AB Teachers design learning activities purposefully to improve student learning. However, the impact of this is usually only evaluated after a course has ended by making use of self-reported data and assessment results. Learning analytics offers the opportunity to collect, analyse and visualise feedback on activities using authentic data in real-time. Incorporating learning analytics into the learning design makes justin-time interventions attainable. This paper presents the first steps of the development of a Learning Analytics for Learning Design (LA4LD) tool that is co-created with students and teachers, using a design-based research methodology. Both teachers and students express the need to personalise feedback on learning activities in order to increase the quality of the learning process and want that embedded in the tool.

AB In the course of the last few years, many educational and research communities have been deeply invested in the development of learning analytics. Learning analytics measures the effectiveness and efficiency of learning environments, in order to understand the needs of learners and to improve the teaching process. The research presented in this paper uses Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization (PPSO) mechanism to analyze and predict a dynamic learning path for learners based on competence and meta-competence values observed in a learning environment. The proposed system is able to auto-configure and auto-customize itself to offer personalized and individualized instruction, and calculate an optimal learning pathway for learners. Furthermore, it provides on-demand and adaptive support for learners based on their needs. Experimental evaluations -carried out within a Java Programming course - demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.

AB Learning analytics depicts the process of assessing, evaluating, and measuring student performance and the effectiveness of the teaching and learning process delivered by educators. The objective of learning analytics is to optimize students' learning by maximizing the pedagogical technique, assistive technologies, and cognitive abilities of learners. It is argued that the learning can be varied and subjective, however, with the use of technology, big data application, and machine learning, the process of learning can be empowered through learning analytics. This whole ecosystem proves to be the best practice in understanding student learning needs in tangible ways. The researcher employed descriptive and correlational studies to determine the relationship between learning analytics features and studied variables. Three dimensions of learning analytics were involved in the study: summative, real-time, and predictive. A set of questionnaires was distributed to 350 students enrolled in various programs at Universiti Putra Malaysia. Based on the results, it was found that demographic profiles of the respondents include age, gender, type of student, credit hours intake, concern on achievement, learning preference, and learning motivation contributed significantly to learning analytic features when ANOVA and T-Test being employed in the analytical procedures. Our finding also revealed that there was a strong and positive direction of learning analytic features based on the Pearson Correlation report. In summary, the current study unveils the influence of demographic characteristics of learners on learning analytic features. It is apparent from the findings that the learning analytics features shall consider the extrinsic and intrinsic values of the learners that include assistive technology, learning performance, and motivation. With a blend of values in understanding learning analytics study, the extensive study related to learners profiling is necessary to empower the learning experience comprehensively.

   OBJECTIVES
AB Precision education is now recognized as a new challenge of applying artificial intelligence, machine learning, and learning analytics to improve both learning performance and teaching quality. To promote precision education, digital learning platforms have been widely used to collect educational records of students' behavior, performance, and other types of interaction. On the other hand, the increasing volume of students' learning behavioral data in virtual learning environments provides opportunities for mining data on these students' learning patterns. Accordingly, identifying students' online learning patterns on various digital learning platforms has drawn the interest of the learning analytics and educational data mining research communities. In this study, the authors applied data analytics methods to examine the learning patterns of students using an ebook system for one semester in an undergraduate course. The authors used a clustering approach to identify subgroups of students with different learning patterns. Several subgroups were identified, and the students' learning patterns in each subgroup were determined accordingly. In addition, the association between these students' learning patterns and their learning outcomes from the course was investigated. The findings of this study provide educators opportunities to predict students' learning outcomes by analyzing their online learning behaviors and providing timely intervention for improving their learning experience, which achieves one of the goals of learning analytics as part of precision education.

AB Collaborative learning flow patterns (CLFPs) encode solutions to recurrent pedagogical problems, which have been successfully applied to the design of learning experiences. However, the pedagogical knowledge encoded in these patterns has seldom been exploited in learning analytics (LA). This paper analyzes four of the most common CLFPs to extract the intrinsic constraints that lead to a successful collaborative learning activity, and use them to enhance existing LA solutions. To understand the added value of applying such codified knowledge in LA, we present evidence from five authentic case studies in which such constraints aided university teachers in monitoring complex collaborative scripts. The results not only illustrate quantitatively such added value but also unearth qualitative benefits, such as raising practitioners awareness about how the current state of activities may affect future phases of the script.

AB Personalized learning has the potential to transfer the focus of higher education from teacher-centered to learner-centered environments. The purpose of this integrative literature review was to provide an overview of personalized learning theory, learning technology that supports the personalization of higher education, current practices, as well as case studies of implementing technology models to support personalized learning. The review results revealed the following: three technological models that support personalized learning within blended learning environments in higher education, an increase in personalized learning implementation in higher education with the support of the referenced technology models and platforms, and a lack of data-driven and independent research studies that investigate the effectiveness and impact of the personalized learning and technology models on student learning. The article informs educators and higher education administrators of the emerging models, platforms, and related opportunities to implement personalized learning in higher education settings. The review discusses the barriers, challenges, and theoretical and practical implications of implementing a personalized learning approach in higher education. Finally, recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB While learning analytics frameworks precede the official launch of learning analytics in 2011, there has been a proliferation of learning analytics frameworks since. This systematic review of learning analytics frameworks between 2011 and 2021 in three databases resulted in an initial corpus of 268 articles and conference proceeding papers based on the occurrence of "learning analytics" and "framework" in titles, keywords and abstracts. The final corpus of 46 frameworks were analysed using a coding scheme derived from purposefully selected learning analytics frameworks. The results found that learning analytics frameworks share a number of elements and characteristics such as source, development and application focus, a form of representation, data sources and types, focus and context. Less than half of the frameworks consider student data privacy and ethics. Finally, while design and process elements of these frameworks may be transferable and scalable to other contexts, users in different contexts will be best-placed to determine their transferability/scalability.

AB This research aims to investigate the relationship between self-regulated learning awareness, learning behaviors, and learning performance in ubiquitous learning environments. In order to do so, psychometric data about self-regulated learning and log data such as marker, annotation, accessing device types that stored the learning management system were collected and analyzed using multiple regression analysis with stepwise method. The results indicated that self-efficacy, internal value, and the number of read slides had a significant influence on the final score, and the awareness of cognitive learning strategy use has slightly significant power to predict the final score.

AB Despite the ubiquity of learning in the everyday life of most workplaces, the learning analytics community only has paid attention to such settings very recently. One probable reason for this oversight is the fact that learning in the workplace is often informal, hard to grasp and not univocally defined. This paper summarizes the state of the art of Workplace Learning Analytics (WPLA), extracted from a systematic literature review of five academic databases as well as other known sources in the WPLA community. Our analysis of existing proposals discusses particularly on the role of different conceptions of learning and their influence on the LA proposals' design and technology choices. We end the paper by discussing opportunities for future work in this emergent field.

AB The wide range of data produced by participants in learning processes has led to increased interest in the collection and analysis of data to support data-driven decision making at all levels of educational institutions. The paper is devoted to the emerging field of Learning Analytics that has been researched to identify all stakeholders and their interests in the Learning Analytics results. It presents a comprehensive approach to Learning Analytics in the field of Higher Education from the perspective of all different stakeholders, which aims to improve its methods of approaching and analyzing learning data. On the basis of a literature review in the field and an investigation of requirements for quality evaluation of learning in higher education the corresponding stakeholder groups are identified (students, teachers, programme managers, deans, rectors, members of quality commissions and external quality experts) and 6 models (1 model per each stakeholder group) for data collection and personalized and meaningful analysis are proposed for the needs of Learning Analytics. Each model consists of measurable indicators allowing the relevant stakeholder to track data for students' learning or training for different purposes, e.g. monitoring, analysis, forecast, intervention, recommendations, etc., but finally to improve the quality of learning and teaching processes. In the next stages of the study, the developed models will be verified with the help of representatives from the various stakeholders and then on that basis software tools for Learning Analytics automation will be developed.

AB With the popularity of many massive online courses (MOOCs) and relevant platforms such as the Coursera, edX and Udemy, open learning and education will obviously become a very influential and significant sector in education all over the world, especially for developing countries like China and India with large population sizes and huge demands for tertiary education to develop the knowledge-based economy. Due to the potentially large class sizes for courses on an open learning platform, it can be difficult to monitor each individual or averaged performance in each open learning course, thus possibly leading to a relatively higher dropout rate at the end of the course. This is where computationally intelligent methods such as the machine learning or learning analytics techniques may help to effectively monitor each individual or group performance in an open learning course. In this work, we propose a cloud-based and personalized learning platform enhanced by a very efficient and intelligent facial analytics algorithm to capture learners' real-time responses when viewing any open educational resources such as the Ted Talks, YouTube or MERLOT on mobile devices. After analyzing learners' instant responses and attention spans, it may help to quickly identify those difficult and/or less interesting topics. Besides, interactive quizzes can be flexibly added by course instructors into different sections of an online educational resource to evaluate each individual learner's actual level of understanding while relevant video files or course material is being streamed onto the learner's mobile device from the Dropbox cloud storage. All the data about the learning progress will be securely uploaded onto a password-protected cloud computing platform for further analyzes. Furthermore, the cloud platform ensures the interoperability of various mobile devices in this newly enhanced learning analytic system with which some initial and positive students' feedback was collected. This work clearly provides many promising directions for future extensions of the next-generation open learning and education platform.

AB From massive open online courses (MOOC) to the smaller scale use of learning management systems, many students interact with online platforms that are meant to support learning. Investigations into the use of these systems have considered how well students learn when certain approaches are employed. However, we do not fully understand how course type or system design influence student actions and experiences, meaning prior findings cannot be properly interpreted and used because we do not understand how these factors influence those findings. Accordingly, we conducted a study to compare student experiences and behaviors across learning management systems and courses from a learning analytics perspective. Differences in student behaviors and experiences highlight how system design and the nature of the course interact: Students reported increased learning support when using a system that foregrounds student interaction through discussion forums, but this relationship did not hold across all course types. Similarly, students from the content-delivery focused system spent more time online while feeling less supported regardless of which type of course they were taking. This newly found evidence for the often-interrelated influence that the course and system have on student experiences and behaviors should therefore be considered when selecting a system to meet particular pedagogical goals.

AB Purpose - The explosive growth in the number of digital tools utilized in everyday learning activities generates data at an unprecedented scale, providing exciting challenges that cross scholarly communities. This paper aims to provide an overview of learning analytics (LA) with the aim of helping members of the information and learning sciences communities understand how educational Big Data is relevant to their research agendas and how they can contribute to this growing new field.
   Design/methodology/approach - Highlighting shared values and issues illustrates why LA is the perfect meeting ground for information and the learning sciences, and suggests how by working together effective LA tools can be designed to innovate education.
   Findings - Analytics-driven performance dashboards are offered as a specific example of one research area where information and learning scientists can make a significant contribution to LA research. Recent reviews of existing dashboard studies point to a dearth of evaluation with regard to either theory or outcomes. Here, the relevant expertise from researchers in both the learning sciences and information science is offered as an important opportunity to improve the design and evaluation of student-facing dashboards.
   Originality/value - This paper outlines important ties between three scholarly communities to illustrate how their combined research expertise is crucial to advancing how we understand learning and for developing LA-based interventions that meet the values that we all share.

AB Learning analytics (LA) constitutes a key opportunity to support learning design (LD) in blended learning environments. However, details as to how LA supports LD in practice and information on teacher experiences with LA are limited. This study explores the potential of LA to inform LD based on a one-semester undergraduate blended learning course at a Norwegian university. Our findings indicate that creating valuable connections between LA and LD requires a detailed analysis of student checkpoints (e.g., online logins) and process analytics (e.g., online content and interaction dynamics) to find meaningful learning behaviour patterns that can be forwarded to teachers in retrospect to support the redesign of courses. Moreover, the teachers in our study found the LA visualizations to be valuable for understanding student online learning processes, but they also requested the timely sharing of aggregated LA visualizations in a simple, easy-to-interpret format, yet detailed enough to be informative and actionable. We conclude the paper by arguing that the potential of LA to support LD is improved when multiple levels of LA are considered.

AB In the framework of the FP6 project UNITE a number of e-Learning scenarios have been developed, covering different educational contexts, pedagogical concepts and subjects (environmental education, ICT, language learning, etc.), bridging thus the gap between formal and informal learning settings. All e-Learning scenarios have taken into consideration the diverse cultural and educational backgrounds of the school environments they would be implemented in.
   The scenarios follow a constructivist approach and promote the inductive and deductive way of learning, as pupils are encouraged to categorize, test structures and apply the knowledge obtained to new situations. These scenarios promote and support problem-based learning, where pupils can be creative, learn how to combine knowledge from different thematic areas, can think critically, analytically, and learn how to solve real problems. Besides pedagogy, scenarios highlight the strengths of UNITE platform itself enabling both in-school and out-of-school activities (also through m-learning).
   The scenario development process followed in UNITE has included a number of stages that are discussed in this paper. Namely the design of a scenario map based on which e-Learning scenarios emerge, an e-Learning scenario template to structure scenarios in a consistent manner, a number of scenario examples to serve as guides, two handbooks (namely Teacher's and Content Development) to aid teachers, as well as formative and summative evaluation. Teachers were actively involved from the early stages, by being consulted, providing feedback and input in many topics. The UNITE approach for scenario development is in fact a user centered approach; the teacher sets the learning objectives of his/her lesson, designs the learning activities, prepares the content that he/she needs, chooses the tools he/she will use, defines the assessment strategy he/she will follow, and designs the e-Learning scenario taking into consideration the needs of his/her class.

AB The emergence of Learning Analytics has brought benefits to the educational field, as it can be used to analyse authentic data from students to identify the problems encountered in e-learning and to provide intervention to assist students. However, much is still unknown about the development of Learning Analytics intervention in terms of providing personalised learning materials to students to meet their needs in order to enhance their learning performance. Thus, this study aims to develop a Learning Analytics intervention in e-learning to enhance students' learning performance. In order to develop the intervention, four stages of Learning Analytics Cycle proposed by Clow: learner, data, metrics and intervention were carried out, integrating with two well-known models: Felder-Silverman's and Keller's Attention, Relevance, Confidence and Satisfaction (ARCS) models in e-learning, to develop various Learning Objects in e-learning. After that, a case study was carried out to assess this intervention with various validated research instruments. A quantitative approach involving a one-group pre-test-post-test experimental design was adopted, which consists of a population of 50 undergraduate students who enrolled in the Information System Management in Education course. The results indicated that the Learning Analytics intervention is useful, as it overall helped the majority of students to enhance their motivation, academic achievement, cognitive engagement and cognitive retention in e-learning. From this study, readers can understand the way to implement the Learning Analytics intervention which is proved to made positive impact on students' learning achievement with the Cohen's d of 5.669. Lastly, this study contributes significant new knowledge to the current understanding of how Learning Analytics intervention can perform to optimize students' learning experience and also serves to fill a gap in research on Learning Analytics, namely the lack of development of interventions to assist students.

AB The paper is aimed to analyse application of learning analytics (LA) methods to enhance learning quality and effectiveness in virtual learning environments (VLEs) by the means of learning personalisation. Since study and learning processes significantly moved to virtual environment, it is very important to analyse what is state-of-the-art in the area. Therefore, first of all, systematic review has been performed. The data collected from VLEs can be aggregated over large numbers of students and can contain many variables that LA / educational data mining (EDM) algorithms can explore for model building. Research presented in the paper has also shown that these LA methods and techniques could be successfully used to enhance learning quality and effectiveness by the means of learning personalisation in VLEs. In the paper, five-stage methodology is presented aimed at enhancing students' learning quality and effectiveness.

AB Evidence-based education has become more relevant in the current technology-enhanced teaching-learning era. This paper introduces how Educational BIG data has the potential to generate such evidence. As evidence-based education traditionally hooks on the meta-analysis of the literature, so there are existing platforms that support manual input of evidence as structured information. However, such platforms often focus on researchers as end-users and its design is not aligned to the practitioners' workflow. In our work, we propose a technology-mediated process of capturing teaching-learning cases (TLCs) using a learning analytics framework. Each case is primarily a single data point regarding the result of an intervention and multiple such cases would generate an evidence of intervention effectiveness. To capture TLCs in our current context, our system automatically conducts statistical modelling of learning logs captured from Learning Management Systems (LMS) and an e-book reader. Indicators from those learning logs are evaluated by the Linear Mixed Effects model to compute whether an intervention had a positive learning effect. We present two case studies to illustrate our approach of extracting case effectiveness from two different learning contexts - one at a junior-high math class where email messages were sent as intervention and another in a blended learning context in a higher education physics class where an active learning strategy was implemented. Our novelty lies in the proposed automated approach of data aggregation, analysis, and case storing using a Learning Analytics framework for supporting evidence-based practice more accessible for practitioners.

ID AGREEMENT
AB Various research work have highlighted the importance of modeling learner's personality to provide a personalized computer based learning. In particular, questionnaire is the most used method to model personality which can be long and not motivating. This makes learners unwilling to take it. Therefore, this paper refers to Learning Analytics (LA) to implicitly model learners' personalities based on their traces generated during the learning -playing process. In this context, an LA system and an educational game were developed. Forty five participants (34 learners and 11 teachers) participated in an experiment to evaluate the accuracy level of the learners' modeling results and the teachers' satisfaction degree towards this LA system. The obtained results highlighted that the LA system has a high level of accuracy and a "good" agreement degree compared to the questionnaire paper. Besides, the teachers found the LA system easy to use, useful and they were willing to use it in the future.

AB A smart learning environment (SLE) is characterized by the key provision of personalized learning experiences. To approach different degrees of personalization in online learning, this paper introduces a framework called SCALE that tracks finer level learning experiences and translates them into opportunities for custom feedback. A prototype version of the SCALE system has been used in a study to track the habits of novice programmers. Growth of coding competencies of first year engineering students has been captured in a continuous manner. Students have been provided with customized feedback to optimize their learning path in programming. This paper describes key aspects of our research with the SCALE system and highlights results of the study.

AB With the increasing development and adoption of digital technologies for education, more data gathered from educational contexts are being analyzed to give actionable insights to stakeholders. As a data-driven approach for better understanding and optimizing learning and the learning environment, learning analytics has the potential to contribute to smart learning. However, current learning analytics lacks knowledge awareness, an important component in smart learning. This paper draws upon research in the domain of smart learning, reflects on current research on methods and processes in learning analytics, and proposes a framework for knowledge-aware learning analytics for smart learning.

AB In 2014, The Egyptian Ministry of Education carried out the latest strategic plan for developing pre-university education that promotes using Active Learning technique, especially in the primary stage. The main objective of this research is to set up a reference guide for enhancing the current situation of Egyptian Primary Public School design that shows a great controversy between Architects, Designers, The General Authority for Educational Buildings and the proposed strategies assigned by the Ministry of Education. Accordingly, Three main parts have been incorporated, the theoretical, the analytical and the empirical ones. In the theoretical part, a comparative evaluative study is introduced between the local design strategy (Teacher-Centered Learning) and the global design strategy (Student-Centered Learning). The Analytical part includes a detailed comparison between two local Egyptian international schools and one global school. The main purpose of this part is to analyze them by using the latest classification of design patterns by Prakash Nair and Randall Fielding for Active learning school Environment as an assessment tool focusing on the key elements in architectural design to enrich the realms of students experience; Spatial, psychological, physiological and behavioural aspects and its corresponding attributes upon the extent of interaction between students and teachers with their surrounding Environment. While in the Empirical part, various methodological approaches including non-participation observation to local users (main involved users of target groups) in addition to a series of questionnaires are discussed. The result of the study reveals a Comparative Evaluative study between the two strategies and concluding the best practice for Active Learning Primary School design to be compatible with the Egyptian future strategic plans and culture.

AB Student's learning happens where the learner is, rather than being constrained to a single physical or digital environment. It is of high relevance for the LAK community to provide analytics support in blended learning scenarios where students can interact at diverse learning spaces and with a variety of educational tools. This workshop aims to gather the sub community of LAK researchers, learning scientists and researchers in other areas, interested in the intersection between ubiquitous, mobile and/or classroom learning analytics. The underlying concern is how to integrate and coordinate learning analytics seeking to understand the particular pedagogical needs and context constraints to provide learning analytics support across digital and physical spaces. The goals of the workshop are to consolidate the Cross-LAK sub-community and provide a forum for idea generation that can build up further collaborations. The workshop will also serve to disseminate current work in the area by both producing proceedings of research papers and working towards a journal special issue.

AB MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have revolutionized the way we learn. But a major challenge faced by MOOCs is the high dropout rates among students at various stages of the course. It is important to identify the students at risk in terms of those who are likely to drop out at some stage of the course; and those who might not meet the required passing criteria. In this paper, a model is proposed to identify learners who are at risk in an online course using association analysis which is done with dataset of students who have taken the course previously. Identifying such learners who are at risk and providing them real time feedback would help the students to be more aware of their current performance and to improve upon it. Several experiments were conducted to test the performance of the proposed work and the results show that the proposed model identifies 90% of the learners who are at risk. Out of 4,74,977 students, 4,32,502 were identified as at risk students based on the experimental analysis.

AB National educational standards stress the importance of science and mathematics learning for today's students. However, across disciplines, students frequently struggle to meet learning goals about core concepts like energy. Digital learning environments enhanced with artificial intelligence hold the promise to address this issue by providing individualized instruction and support for students at scale. Scaffolding and feedback, for example, are both most effective when tailored to students' needs. Providing individualized instruction requires continuous assessment of students' individual knowledge, abilities, and skills in a way that is meaningful for providing tailored support and planning further instruction. While continuously assessing individual students' science and mathematics learning is challenging, intelligent tutoring systems show that it is feasible in principle. However, the learning environments in intelligent tutoring systems are typically not compatible with the vision of how effective K-12 science and mathematics learning looks like. This leads to the challenge of designing digital learning environments that allow for both - meaningful science and mathematics learning and the reliable and valid assessment of individual students' learning. Today, digital devices such as tablets, laptops, or digital measurement systems increasingly enter science and mathematics classrooms. In consequence, students' learning increasingly produces rich product and process data. Learning Analytics techniques can help to automatically analyze this data in order to obtain insights about individual students' learning, drawing on general theories of learning and relative to established domain specific models of learning, i.e., learning progressions. We call this approach Learning Progression Analytics (LPA). In this manuscript, building of evidence-centered design (ECD), we develop a framework to guide the development of learning environments that provide meaningful learning activities and data for the automated analysis of individual students' learning - the basis for LPA and scaling individualized instruction with artificial intelligence.

AB The paper aims to analyse possible application of learning analytics / educational data mining (LA / EDM) to support learning personalisation and optimisation in terms of enhancing learning quality and effectiveness. LA / EDM are known as the measurement, collection, analysis, and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimising learning and the environments in which it occurs. Researchers, teachers, and policy makers should have a clear idea of what kinds of data, methods, and techniques are needed to optimise learning and its environments. For this purpose, first of all, systematic review of relevant scientific literature on LA / EDM application was conducted. After that, findings of the systematic review concerning possible use and impact of learning analytics on learning personalisation and optimisation are presented. In order to identify scientific methods, tools, techniques and possible results on application of LA / EDM to personalise learning, systematic literature review method devised by Kitchenham has been used. The following research question has been raised to perform systematic literature review: "What are existing LA / EDM methods, tools, and techniques applied to personalise learning?" During the last years (2014-2016), 519 papers were found in Thomson Reuters Web of Science database on the topic "learning analytics", including 278 articles, and 174 papers were found on the topic "educational data mining", including 77 articles. After applying Kitchenham's systematic review methodology, on the last stage 47 suitable articles were identified to further detailed analysis on the topic "learning analytics", and 33 - on the topic "educational data mining". After eliminating duplicating articles, 67 suitable articles were further analysed. Systematic review has shown that, most recently, new data analytics approaches are creating new ways of understanding trends and behaviours in students that can be used to improve learning design, strengthen student retention, provide early warning signals concerning individual students and help to personalise the learner's experience. Thus, systematic review has shown that LA / EDM could be helpful to personalise learning, but future research is needed in the area, and, first of all, we should clearly identify the main trends concerning application of LA / EDM to personalise learning. Based on systematic review results, the authors have identified the main trends concerning application of LA / EDM to support learning personalisation and optimisation. They are: (1) LA / EDM support self-directed autonomous learning; (2) LA / EDM systems become essential tools of educational management; and (3) most teaching is delegated to computers, and LA / EDM based recommendations will be better and more reliable than those that can be produced by even the best-trained humans. In the paper, an original learning personalisation and optimisation approach based on identification of learners' needs and application of intelligent technologies is presented. After that, analysis of implementing the aforementioned trends of applying LA / EDM to support learning personalisation and optimisation is provided. This analysis has shown that further development of the authors' approach on learning personalisation and optimisation is helpful to implement all three aforementioned trends of applying LA / EDM in education.

AB The field of education technology is embracing a use of learning analytics to improve student experiences of learning. Along with exponential growth in this area is an increasing concern of the interpretability of the analytics from the student experience and what they can tell us about learning. This study offers a way to address some of the concerns of collecting and interpreting learning analytics to improve student learning by combining observational and self-report data. The results present two models for predicting student academic performance which suggest that a combination of both observational and self-report data explains a significantly higher variation in student outcomes. The results offer a way into discussing the quality of interpretations of learning analytics and their usefulness for helping to improve the student experience of learning and also suggest a pathway for future research into this area.

AB The continuous improvement of the teaching-learning process has priority in educational environments at all levels of edu-cation. The objective of this work is to analyze the interaction of developer learning and learning analytics for the continuous improvement of the teaching-learning process. A quantitative methodology was used and the main theoretical level methods were the synthetic analytical and the inductive-deductive and at the mathematical statistical level the statistics of central ten-dency, dispersion tests of normality and Friedman's non-parametric test with their corresponding statistics. The main results were that the measurements behaved below in the autonomous component and with very good scores in the two remaining components, experimental practical and direct contact with the teacher and where the evaluations of the academic and non-academic are associated with the characteristics of the of student that this career has.

AB Instructors may design and implement formative assessments on technology-enhanced platforms (e.g., online quizzes) with the intention of encouraging the use of effective learning strategies like active retrieval of information and spaced practice among their students. However, when students interact with unsupervised technology-enhanced learning platforms, instructors are often unaware of students' actual use of the learning tools with respect to the pedagogical design. In this study, we designed and extracted five variables from the Canvas quiz-log data, which can provide insights into students' learning behaviors. Anchoring our conceptual basis on the influential conversational framework, we find that learning analytics (LA) can provide instructors with critical information related to students' learning behaviors, thereby supporting instructors' inquiry into student learning in unsupervised technology-enhanced platforms. Our findings suggest that the information that LA provides may enable instructors to provide meaningful feedback to learners and improve the existing learning designs.

AB This study is based on a novel conceptual framework, precision education, and takes a blended Python programming course as an example to explore how to implement precision education that includes diagnosis, prediction, prevention and treatment. Precision education follows the principles of personalized services for precision medicine. Its purpose is to strengthen the learning risk prediction and early intervention mentioned in emerging learning analytics through big data, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies, thereby improving teacher teaching quality and student learning efficiency. This study is based on the design of the e-book learning dashboard, so that teachers can quickly understand students' learning status, and improve the e-book through students' feedback on the dashboard to achieve precision diagnosis. Next, this study uses machine learning algorithms to predict students' learning performance, and thus determine whether students are at-risk to achieve precision prediction. Finally, through the correspondence between reading strategy and reading sequence, and then clearly distinguish the types of students by grouping, and use it as a treatment target for precision treatment and prevention. It is hoped that this empirical study can be used as a case study for implementing precision education.

   analytics-based process feedback in a large course

AB Recent developments in educational technologies have provided a viable solution to the challenges associated with scaling personalised feedback to students. However, there is currently little empirical evidence about the impact such scaled feedback has on student learning progress and study behaviour. This paper presents the findings of a study that looked at the impact of a learning analytics (LA)-based feedback system on students' selfregulated learning and academic achievement in a large, first-year undergraduate course. Using the COPES model of self-regulated learning (SRL), we analysed the learning operations of students, by way of log data from the learning management system and e-book, as well as the products of SRL, namely, performance on course assessments, from three years of course offerings. The latest course offering involved an intervention condition that made use of an educational technology to provide LA-based process feedback. Propensity score matching was employed to match a control group to the student cohort enrolled in the latest course offering, creating two equal-sized groups of students who received the feedback (the experimental group) and those who did not (the control group). Growth mixture modelling and mixed between-within ANOVA were also employed to identify differences in the patterns of online self-regulated learning operations over the course of the semester. The results showed that the experimental group showed significantly different patterns in their learning operations and performed better in terms of final grades. Moreover, there was no difference in the effect of feedback on final grades among students with different prior academic achievement scores, indicating that the LA-based feedback deployed in this course is able to support students' learning, regardless of prior academic standing.

AB Currently there is a need for studying learning strategies within Massive Open Online Courses | (MOOCs), especially in the context of in-service teachers. This study aims to bridge this gap and try to understand how in-service teachers approach and regulate their learning in MOOCs. In particular, it examines the strategies used by the in-service teachers as they study a course on how to teach programming. The study implemented a combination of unsupervised clustering and process mining in a large MOOC (n = 27,538 of which 8,547 completed). The results show similar trends compared to previous studies conducted within MOOCs, indicating that teachers are similar to other groups of students based on their learning strategies. The analysis identified three subgroups (i.e., clusters) with different strategies: (1) efficient (n = 3596, 42.1%), (2) clickers (n = 1785, 20.9%), and (3) moderates (n = 3,166, 37%). The efficient students finished the course in a short time, spent more time on each lesson, and moved forward between lessons. The clickers took longer to complete the course, repeated the lessons several times, and moved backwards to revise the lessons repeatedly. The moderates represented an intermediate approach between the two previous clusters. As such, our findings indicate that a significant fraction within teachers poorly regulate their learning, and therefore, teacher education should emphasize learning strategies and self-regulating learning skills so that teacher can better learn and transfer their skills to students.

AB Vast amounts of educational data created by learners interacting with digital learning tools open up the opportunity to gain insights for improving education at a new level of evidence-based research into learning and teaching. This study is part of a research programme investigating the dynamics and impacts of learning engagement in a challenge-based online learning environment. Learning engagement is a multidimensional concept which includes an individual's ability to behaviourally, cognitively, emotionally, and motivationally engage in an on-going learning process. Challenge-based learning gives significant freedom to the learner to decide what and when to engage and interact with digital learning materials. In light of previous empirical findings, we expect that learning engagement is positively related to learning performance in a challenge-based online learning environment. This study was based on data from the Careers Challenge platform, including transaction data from 8,951 students. Findings indicate that learning engagement in challenge-based online learning environments is, as expected, positively related to learning performance. Implications point toward the need for personalised and adaptive learning environments to be developed in order to cater for the individual needs of learners in challenge-based online learning environments.

AB E-books have been introduced to educational institutions in many countries. The use of e-books in traditional classrooms enables the recording of learning logs. Recently, researchers have begun to carry out learning analytics on the learning logs of e-books. However, there has been limited attention devoted to understanding the types of learning strategies that students employ when they read e-books. In this paper, using e-book learning logs, we examine the learning strategies that students employed when reading e-books. In this paper, we will introduce how to identify learning strategies from e-book learning logs with two case studies. One is "Identifying Learning Strategies Using Clustering" and the other is "Examining Learning Strategies Using Sequential Analysis."

AB The aim of the paper is to present Go-Lab and Moodle learning platforms as tools suitable for applying Learning Analytics to improve learning. Moodle is one of the most popular open source learning platforms used both in schools and Universities, and Go-Lab is learning platform for Inquiry-Based Science Education in schools developed in Go-Lab project funded by EU 7FP programme and continued to be developed in new Next-Lab project funded by Horizon 2020. Learning Analytics aims to collect and analyse user activities to make learning and learning environments more effective and efficient. Go-Lab Learning Analytics services provide means to track user activities and analyse this tracked data. This provides the foundation for guidance mechanisms for students through scaffolding, as well as intelligent decision support for teachers and lab owners. More specifically, Learning Analytics services provide support for recommendations, intelligent feedback for students, and analytical reports that help to design better Inquiry-Based Learning scenarios and spaces. The add-on services consist of the bartering platform and the lab booking system to support Go-Lab Portal in different aspects. The bartering platform offers teachers peer assistance through a tutor social platform for expertise sharing related to online labs and inquiry learning spaces. Teachers are motivated to help other teachers and share their skills and knowledge about online labs on the bartering platform. On the other hand, there are the number of reports, blocks and other plugins for Moodle that provide Learning Analytics in this platform such as logs, activity, statistics etc. which are useful for students, teachers, administrators and decision-makers. A number of systems can be integrated with Moodle to provide Learning Analytics information. The paper is organised as follows: (1) systematic review on research topic, (2) analysis of Learning Analytics / educational data mining tools used in both platforms, (3) comparative analysis of possibilities provided by Learning Analytics tools in both platforms to improve learning, and (4) discussion and conclusion. The work presented in this paper is partially supported by the European Commission under Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme - as part of the Next-Lab project (Grant Agreement Number No 731685).

SO TEACHING IN HIGHER EDUCATION

DT Article; Early Access
DE Learning analytics; mediated learning
ID STUDENTS; PERSPECTIVES; TOOLS
AB How can we better mediate processes of learning at large institutions? Learning analytics are used primarily in online and blended learning environments to expose patterns in learning behaviour or interaction. They make use of digital traces from virtual learning environments and combine this with other learner data. The goal is to assist both educators and learners in improving their practice. In this work, we apply the concepts of 'psychological tools' and more 'knowledgeable others' from Lev Vygotsky, and Reuven Feuerstein's model of Mediated Learning Experiences to define prerequisites that learning analytics at scale must reach, in order to be a meaningful tool for mediating learning. We present findings from an in-depth qualitative study with educators and learners at a large, online institution of higher education. We then map insights gained from this study to our model of mediated learning. The resulting analysis and recommendations indicate that we need more inclusive and dedicated practices in learning analytics development, as well as institutional will to create more complex and meaningful tools.

AB The educational landscape continues to transform significantly in a way that it engages students' interest and improves learning processes. Such an example is the gradual use of educational games, which seem to be an exceptional means to motivate and engage students in ways that will make learning more challenging and interesting for them. However, although educational games are a very interesting tool that could be used in education, an interesting challenge that should be addressed is the identification of all the ways students' progress and results can be measured for examination. This way, there is a high demand for accountability regarding the measurement and analysis of enriched game based learning activities or game-based learning analytics (GBLA). This demand is especially highlighted in one of the most difficult areas of Computer Science, which is computer programming education. In this paper, we are proposing a framework that will guide the incorporation of learning analytics mechanisms in computer programming education. We demonstrate this process through the implementation of the framework in an educational Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game we have developed for the domain.

AB So far, the synergistic relationship between learning design and learning analytics and its impact on learners' educational practices have been investigated. However, little work has been done to show how integrated learning design based on constructivism learning theory and learning analytics can affect learners' engagement and self-regulation. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effect of the Constructivist Learning Design and Learning Analytics (CLDLA) Model on learners' engagement and self-regulation. In this experimental study, 50 graduate students at Iranian' Allameh Tabataba'i University were asked to participate in a Moodle course called "Teaching Skills" and fill out Agentic Engagement Scale and Self-Regulation Questionnaires in two steps as a pre-test and post-test measurements. Analysis of the data indicated that the CLDLA model has a positive impact on learners' engagement and self-regulation. Based on the results, recommendations for further research and educational practices are suggested.

AB The use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) has been ubiquitous in higher education. To better understand students' behaviors and facilitate students' learning through CMC, this study aimed to classify messages in Facebook learning group which was created as an on-line discussion board. Different machine learning and deep learning classification models were proposed, trained and testified with corpuses from PTT, one of the famous on-line forums in Taiwan. Furthermore, the classification of Facebook messages by these well-trained models were compared with human coding. Results revealed that recurrent neural network (RNN) with word to vector (W2V) for feature extraction demonstrated the best performance in accuracy. In addition, the combination of RNN and TF-IDF was proved to have the highest correlation with human work. Implications for artificial intelligence (AI) in education context was discussed.

AB Learning analytics (LA) has been increasingly using in teaching and learning. However, in the field of applied linguistics, the use of LA has only begun to touch the surface. There is a need for understanding how LA and learning design (LD) influence each other and provide useful information to language teachers in the context of specific courses or learning environments. In this study, a retrospective analysis was conducted to identify the factors influencing LA for collaborative language learning in classrooms, from a holistic perspective by integrating LA, LD, and teacher inquiry. The findings suggested that (1) LA focused on interactions can inform pedagogical refinement effectively when LD in language learning is premised on social constructivist theories; (2) LA supported teacher inquiry and LD on condition that the teacher holds innovation-oriented beliefs and the participatory culture between teachers and researchers. The study provided insights into the use of LA in collaborative language learning classrooms that focus on collecting and evaluating learners' interaction process beyond gleaning linguistic or behavioral facts. Professional development implications and future research are also addressed.

AB The use of learning management systems (LMSs) for learning and knowledge sharing has accelerated quickly both in education and corporate worlds. Despite the benefits brought by LMSs, the current systems still face significant challenges, including the lack of automation in generating quiz questions and managing courses. Over the past decade, more attention has been accorded to analyzing the rich learning data captured by the systems and developing tools that support contemporary learning modes. This article considers a popular LMS, Moodle, and showcases four innovative projects that aim to extend the system's capabilities and address the abovementioned problems: 1) the Quiz Making Language markup system; 2) an approach to learning analytics using ad-hoc reports and artificial intelligence enabled visualization; 3) automating course administration tasks; and 4) a 4-in-1 learning application for flipped learning. These projects target all main users of the system, including instructors, learners, and administrators. It is illustrated from this study that the innovative use of web technologies and learning analytics has great potentials in improving LMS user productivity, and supporting and informing learning.

AB Many educational institutions use a large number of information systems to automate their activities for different stakeholders' groups - learning management systems, student diary, library system, digital repositories, management system, etc. This leads to a significant increase in the volume and variety of data that can be captured, stored, and harnessed to improve student learning and school effectiveness. Educational institutions are realising that, with the help of technology, they are collecting data that could be very valuable when properly analysed, aligned with learning outcomes, and integrated into a tighter feedback loop with stakeholders. In addition, the analysis of data can help their managers to take data-driven decision making at all levels of educational institutions. The paper presents a comprehensive approach to Learning Analytics in the field of Secondary Education from the perspective of all different stakeholders, which aims to improve its methods of approaching and analysing learning data. On the basis of a literature review in the field and an investigation of requirements for quality evaluation of learning in school education, the corresponding stakeholder groups are identified - students, teachers, class teachers, managers, parents, inspectors and 6 models (1 model per each stakeholder group) for data collection and personalized and meaningful analysis are proposed for the needs of Learning Analytics. Each model consists of measurable indicators allowing the relevant stakeholder to track data for students' learning or training for different purposes, e.g. monitoring, analysis, forecast, intervention, recommendations, etc., but finally to improve the quality of learning and teaching processes. The proposed models are evaluated by the representatives of 4 stakeholder groups - students, teachers, class teachers, parents.

DE Open educational resources; Learning analytics
AB Learning analytics is commonly used in learning management systems to improve learning. This paper presents a method to use learning analytics in open educational resources. The visiting logs in an open educational resources system - THEOL (Tsinghua Education Online) course union system are categorized by visitors' and resources' university properties (region, educational level and discipline type). The difference between resources' visited count and visitors' visiting count of each category is used to measure the comprehensive index of resources' richness and popularity of this category. Chi-square test and ratio of each category are used to show the difference of different category visitors preferring different category resources. The analysis results can guide administrators on how to share educational resources efficiently.

AB Blended learning (B-learning) has been regarded as an effective instructional and learning mode in recent years. It has also been widely recognized that systematic training is urgently needed for in-service teachers to design, develop and deliver effective B-learning courses. As shown in the literature, in-service teacher training is usually carried out in three formats. The first is face-to-face conducted in a concentrated period of time. There are two constraints in this format: the time constraint on the part of the participants due to other commitments, and the resource constraint on the part of the institution for managing large-scale workshops. The second format is a purely online one, often featuring the lack of effective interaction between the instructor and the participants and among participants themselves. The third type is offered in blended mode. However, most programs do not offer ongoing support for participants or follow-up evaluations. Our research developed and evaluated a five-stage blended training model that caters for the needs of in-service teachers in their professional development for B-learning. It is a practice model enabling participants to learn B-learning in B-learning mode and through the design and implementation of a real blended learning course. This study evaluated 10 institutions across China, which adopted this training model with the participation of 952 teachers between October 2016 and January 2017. Our findings confirm the effectiveness of this model and direct our attention to more in-depth studies on teachers' professional development for B-learning in blended mode.

AB Video learning analytics are not open to education stakeholders, such as researchers and teachers, because online video platforms do not share the interactions of the users with their systems. Nevertheless, video learning analytics are necessary to all researchers and teachers that need to understand and improve the effectiveness of the video lecture pedagogy. In this paper, we present an open video learning analytics service, which is freely accessible online. The video learning analytics service (named SocialSkip) facilitates the analysis of video learning behavior by capturing learners' interactions with the video player (e.g., seek/scrub, play, pause). The service empowers any researcher or teacher to create a custom video-based experiment by selecting: 1) a video lecture from YouTube, 2) quiz questions from Google Drive, and 3) custom video player buttons. The open video analytics system has been validated through dozens of user studies, which produced thousands of video interactions. In this study, we present an indicative example, which highlights the usability and usefulness of the system. In addition to interaction frequencies, the system models the captured data as a learner activity time series. Further research should consider user modeling and personalization in order to dynamically respond to the interactivity of students with video lectures.

AB The application of online learning has increased significantly, recently. One of the key successes in online learning is student interactions. An active learning strategy would engage the students to interact with the course or to get involved in the learning process. The objective of this research was to predict which one of the student activities that would improve the learning outcome of the students? All the activities are related to non-human interaction. One of the activities is concept mapping. All the students' activities in online learning were stored in LMS and the data generated as a learning analytics. A linear regression method was used to analyze the data. This research confirmed that working on exercises by using concept mapping yields significant results in improving the learning outcome of students.

AB The increasing prevalence of learner-centred forms of learning as well as an increase in the number of learners actively participating on a wide range of digital platforms and devices give rise to an ever-increasing stream of learning data. Learning analytics (LA) can enable learners, teachers, and their institutions to better understand and predict learning and performance. However, the pedagogical perspective and matters of learning design have been underrepresented in research thus far. In our paper, we propose a general design framework that includes critical dimensions of LA and assists in creating LA services that support educational practice. On the basis of a two-dimensional framework (individual vs. social, reflection vs. prediction), we then identify four generic approaches to LA aimed at improving learning process and learning outcomes. To demonstrate the application, four use cases are outlined that are based on four previously elaborated generic approaches to LA. Finally, we discuss the validation of the model and close with an outlook on relevant future research.

ID ACHIEVEMENT
AB Distance learning is rapidly gaining ground globally. In this case study, we focused on professional (vocational) teacher education (PTE) student online activity in a blended learning context. We applied learning analytics (LA) to identify students' (n = 19) online study patterns. Our key interest was in determining when and what kinds of online activity and behavior PTE students engage in during their studies. We applied quantitative content analysis to analyze the students' behavior. Moodle's event log enabled us to identify active hours and days, variation in use of learning materials, the impact of interventions, and stumbling blocks to student learning in the study unit. Based on our data, educator availability is an essential factor for good student engagement in digital learning environments. Interaction forums are important for PTE students effective learning. Monday and Tuesday afternoons are the most effective times for educators to be available for PTE students. There is a clear need for contact learning in professional teacher education, even when operating in digital learning environments. It plays an essential role in keeping students' activity alive. It could be beneficial to plan a post-process for students who do not graduate as planned, including regular group meetings for supporting studies, receiving guidance, and meeting peers. PTE students' behavior in a distance learning environment in the context of blended learning follows Zipf's law, which models the occurrence of distinct objects in particular sorts of collections.

ID DESIGN-BASED RESEARCH
AB Following asynchronous online discussion activities as a complex communication process is a demanding task for teachers. In this paper, the authors have explored the potential in supporting such activity through learning analytics. From the beginning, the authors acknowledged the limitations of technology to support the complexities of a pedagogical activity. Therefore, the methodology used was participatory design-based research (DBR) divided into two main stages. The first design phase dealt with the engagement of teachers and pedagogical experts in defining the data and metrics to be used to support the pedagogical concepts. The second consisted of an implementation phase including pilots with students and with crucial engagement of teachers in commenting their understanding over students' learning processes and the feedback the teachers could offer to them. Overall, the students shown improvements in their performance as monitored through the learning analytics group in contrast with control groups. The discussion over the design and its results could be potentially extrapolated to other educational contexts.

AB The implementation of learning analytics may empower distance learning institutions to provide real-time feedback to students and teachers. Given the leading role of the Open University UK (OU) in research and application of learning analytics, this study aims to share the lessons learned from the experiences of 42 participants from a range of faculty, academic and professional positions, and expertise with learning analytics. Furthermore, we explored where distance learning institutions should be going next in terms of learning analytics adoption. The findings from the Learning Analytics User Stories (LAUS) workshop indicated four key areas where more work is needed: communication, personalisation, integrated design, and development of an evidence-base. The workshop outputs signalled the aspiration for an integrated analytics system transcending the entire student experience, from initial student inquiry right through to qualification completion and into life-long learning. We hope that our study will spark discussion on whether (or not) distance learning institutions should pursue the dream of an integrated, personalised, and evidence-based learning analytics system that clearly communicates useful feedback to staff and students, or whether this will become an Orwellian nightmare.

AB Many students in primary education learn arithmetic using adaptive learning technologies (ALTs) on tablets every day. Driven by developments in the emerging field of learning analytics, these technologies adjust problems based on learners' performance. Yet, until now it is largely unclear how students regulate their learning with ALTs. Hence, we explored how learners regulate their effort, accuracy and learning with an ALT using moment-by-moment learning curves. The results indicated that moment-by-moment learning curves did reflect students' accuracy and learning, but no associations with effort were found. Immediate drops were associated with high prior knowledge and suboptimal learning. Immediate peaks were associated with robust learning and pointed to effective student regulation. Close multiple spikes showed moderate learning and lower initial levels of accuracy but, with system support, these students seemed able to regulate their learning. Separated multiple spikes indicated reduced learning and accuracy and potentially signal the inability of students to regulate their learning. In this light, moment-by-moment learning curves seem to be valuable indicators of accuracy regulation during learning with ALTs and could potentially be used in interventions to support SRL with personalized visualizations.

AB We propose a data driven method for decomposing population level learning curve models into mutually exclusive distinctive groups each consisting of similar learning trajectories. We validate this method on six knowledge components from the log data from an online tutoring system ASSISTment. Preliminary analysis reveals interpretable patterns of "skill growth" that correlate with students' performance in the subsequently administered state standardized tests.

AB Increasingly, higher education institutions are exploring the potential of learning analytics to predict student retention, understand learning behaviors, and improve student learning through providing personalized feedback and support. The technical development of learning analytics has outpaced consideration of ethical issues surrounding their use. Of particular concern is the absence of the student voice in decision-making about learning analytics. We explored higher education students' knowledge, attitudes, and concerns about big data and learning analytics through four focus groups (N = 41). Thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts identified six key themes. The first theme, "Uninformed and Uncertain," represents students' lack of knowledge about learning analytics prior to the focus groups. Following the provision of information, viewing of videos and discussion of learning analytics scenarios three further themes: "Help or Hindrance to Learning," "More than a Number," and "Impeding Independence"; represented students' perceptions of the likely impact of learning analytics on their learning. "Driving Inequality" and "Where Will it Stop?" represent ethical concerns raised by the students about the potential for inequity, bias and invasion of privacy and the need for informed consent. A key tension to emerge was how "personal" vs. "collective" purposes or principles can intersect with "uniform" vs. "autonomous" activity. The findings highlight the need the need to engage students in the decision making process about learning analytics.

AB Higher Education must adapt the teaching-learning process to the new challenges of the 21st century. Society demands competitive professionals and responsible citizens for the future. Specific contents will continue to be important for the graduates, but transversal skills will undoubtedly be the most demanded in the labour market. The implementation of active learning methodologies together with the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) will be mandatory to optimize the teaching-learning process, to develop the transversal competences and to reach the adaptive and personalized learning.
   To this respect. Educational platforms, such as Moodie or Google Classroom, will play an essential role. At present, these Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) are the usual way of communication between lecturer and student and are frequently used for direct learning and evaluation purposes. Given the wide functionalities, such as questionnaires, wikis or forums, each user leaves a detailed digital footprint about their activities, which can be analysed and processed to establish patterns of behaviour and learning.
   From the institutional point of view, many countries are promoting the exploitation of Learning Analytics (LA) potential to ensure and improve education quality, to monitor the learning process and to reduce dropout rates by identifying risk cases. On the other hand, Learning Analytics can be used in a more direct way to monitor the learning process in order to implement correction in time, to inform the student and the teacher about the learning progress, even to predict the final success.
   With the aim of monitoring and assessing the reception and the perception from students of the applied methodologies and the recommended resources, the authors have stored and analysed diverse data from the Moodie platform to this end. Innovative experiences in the flipped classroom model (FCM) with help of ICT resources in the subject of Engineering Thermodynamics and Fundamentals of Heat Transfer are here presented, and compared to the light of LA for Degrees in Industrial Technologies Engineering and Chemical Engineering at the University of Zaragoza. Through different information extracted from the Moodie raw data some conclusions have been drawn regarding habits and practices associated to better learning results.

TI Predictive learning analytics and the creation of emotionally adaptive
   learning environments in higher education institutions: a study of
   students' affect responses
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND LEARNING TECHNOLOGY

DE Predictive learning analytics; Emotions; Affect responses; Emotional
   learning analytics
AB Purpose The aims of this study are to examine affective responses of university students when viewing their own predictive learning analytics (PLA) dashboards, and to analyse how those responses are perceived to affect their self-regulated learning behaviour. Design/methodology/approach A total of 42 Northern Irish students were shown their own predicted status of academic achievement on a dashboard. A list of emotions along with definitions was provided and the respondents were instructed to verbalise them during the experience. Post-hoc walk-through conversations with participants further clarified their responses. Content analysis methods were used to categorise response patterns. Findings There is a significant variation in ways students respond to the predictions: they were curious and motivated, comforted and sceptical, confused and fearful and not interested and doubting the accuracy of predictions. The authors show that not all PLA-triggered affective states motivate students to act in desirable and productive ways. Research limitations/implications This small-scale exploratory study was conducted in one higher education institution with a relatively small sample of students in one discipline. In addition to the many different categories of students included in the study, specific efforts were made to include "at-risk" students. However, none responded. A larger sample from a multi-disciplinary background that includes those who are categorised as "at-risk" could further enhance the understanding. Practical implications The authors provide mixed evidence for students' openness to learn from predictive learning analytics scores. The implications of our study are not straightforward, except to proceed with caution, valuing benefits while ensuring that students' emotional well-being is protected through a mindful implementation of PLA systems. Social implications Understanding students' affect responses contributes to the quality of student support in higher education institutions. In the current era on online learning and increasing adaptation to living and learning online, the findings allow for the development of appropriate strategies for implementing affect-aware predictive learning analytics (PLA) systems. Originality/value The current study is unique in its research context, and in its examination of immediate affective states experienced by students who viewed their predicted scores, based on their own dynamic learning data, in their home institution. It brings out the complexities involved in implementing student-facing PLA dashboards in higher education institutions.

AB Background The use of crowdsourcing in a pedagogically supported form to partner with learners in developing novel content is emerging as a viable approach for engaging students in higher-order learning at scale. However, how students behave in this form of crowdsourcing, referred to as learnersourcing, is still insufficiently explored. Objectives To contribute to filling this gap, this study explores how students engage with learnersourcing tasks across a range of course and assessment designs. Methods We conducted an exploratory study on trace data of 1279 students across three courses, originating from the use of a learnersourcing environment under different assessment designs. We employed a new methodology from the learning analytics (LA) field that aims to represent students' behaviour through two theoretically-derived latent constructs: learning tactics and the learning strategies built upon them. Results The study's results demonstrate students use different tactics and strategies, highlight the association of learnersourcing contexts with the identified learning tactics and strategies, indicate a significant association between the strategies and performance and contribute to the employed method's generalisability by applying it to a new context. Implications This study provides an example of how learning analytics methods can be employed towards the development of effective learnersourcing systems and, more broadly, technological educational solutions that support learner-centred and data-driven learning at scale. Findings should inform best practices for integrating learnersourcing activities into course design and shed light on the relevance of tactics and strategies to support teachers in making informed pedagogical decisions.

AB Learning analytics promises to support adaptive learning in higher education. However, the associated issues around privacy protection, especially their implications for students as data subjects, has been a hurdle to wide-scale adoption. In light of this, we set out to understand student expectations of privacy issues related to learning analytics and to identify gaps between what students desire and what they expect to happen or choose to do in reality when it comes to privacy protection. To this end, an investigation was carried out in a UK higher education institution using a survey (N=674) and six focus groups (26 students). The study highlight a number of key implications for learning analytics research and practice: (1) purpose, access, and anonymity are key benchmarks of ethics and privacy integrity; (2) transparency and communication are key levers for learning analytics adoption; and (3) information asymmetry can impede active participation of students in learning analytics.

DE Learning Analytics; Learning Ecologies; Rhizome; Learning 2.0
AB The penetration of social media in everyday life has resulted in a corresponding growth in the availability of large data-sets, so called 'Big Data', emergent from tracking and/or mining of user interactions in online settings. It is now possible to better support (and even predict) learner/s achievement through analysis of their interactions within online learning environments. Learning Analytics involves the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of online data about learners and their contexts, for the purposes of understanding, adapting and optimizing the process of learning and/or the environments in which it occurs. In the context of education, the analysis of this data has the potential to help us learn more about learners' frames of reference, learning styles, preferred modes of learning and patterns of behavior in learning environments. This paper considers learning analytics in online learning ecologies, and posits the rhizome/rhizomatic thinking introduced by Deleuze and Guattari as inspiration for re-conceptualising the processes of learning analytics in the 21st Century.

AB Learning Analytics Dashboards are important tools that help professors to follow and understand students behavior inside Learning Management Systems. Moodle is one of the most popular and used Learning Management Systems available nowadays, and a number of initiatives have been conducted to offer Learning Analytics features inside it. The present paper describes MAD2, a Learning Analytics Dashboard developed for Moodle that offers different visualizations about students interactions inside the environment, and that uses machine learning techniques to early predict students at-risk of failure. The paper describes the predictive approach implemented inside the tool together with the most important visualization features available to the users. The offering of a tool to early predict students at-risk of failure inside Moodle is an important step to help professors and managers to better assist students during their courses.

AB Background Hyper-video technology allows reflection on learning materials by writing personal notes and by interactions with lecturers and peers through shared posts and replies. While research shows that integrating hyper-videos in educational systems can promote the learning processes and outcomes, an open question remains regarding its actual utilization patterns by students and teachers. Objectives The study aimed to reveal the extent to which students utilize different functions of hyper-videos in real-life learning contexts, and to examine the role of instructional design on hyper-video utilization. Method In a mixed-method design, the study characterized active and passive interactions in hyper-videos in higher education courses, and amongst active interactions, compared shared versus private annotations. Additionally, the study compared voluntary and mandatory instructional design for promoting hyper-video interactions. In particular, we used learning analytics to explore hyper-video patterns in 25 undergraduate and graduate courses. Results and Discussion A log analysis revealed that students wrote most of the posts, while lecturers mainly provided replies to students' posts. Private annotations were more prevalent than shared writing, pointing to the unfulfilled potential of hyper-video annotations to benefit from collaborative learning. A qualitative analysis on instructional design was consistent with quantitative findings, revealing important differences between the courses with mandatory versus voluntary hyper-video integration in pedagogical design, and in cognitive presence and teaching presence, based on the community of inquiry framework. Major takeaways Findings point to an unfulfilled potential of hyper-video technology to promote active and collaborative learning. This highlights the role of design and instructive guidance when integrating technology into educational systems.

AB This article presents an experience report of an intervention project in Basic Education in a public school, addressing the use of Data Mining and Learning Analytics for teaching and learning processes. In particular, the project aims to identify, among eight mathematical contents, which are those that students have more difficulties. In this context, digital games referring to the subjects were developed, thus raising relevant information for the construction of a dataset, in which Learning Analysis techniques, Educational Data Mining and Unsupervised Learning strategies were used together. Furthermore, for each technique mentioned, different software were applied, such as Jclic and Orange Data Mining Canvas, as well as the Knowledge Discovery in Databases methodology. The results obtained show that it was possible to identify the contents that the students had difficulties through the set of applied approaches, reaching the research goal. The findings reinforce the potential for collecting, using and analyzing data for a more personalized and immersive learning, aiming to conduct and provide assertive feedbacks for teachers and school managers to assist in intelligent decision-making in the educational environment.

AB Personalized learning requires technology in order to feed information about the learners' preferences, achievements and needs. However, many available works have focused either on fully automated processes such as prediction or recommendation of learning plan. In fact, integration of human into the machine learning loop would improve the performance of the assistive technology compared to separated models. In this paper we propose an approach for personalized learning that integrates human and machine learning, and utilize learning analytics, chatbot and recommendation system. We present our proposed idea and work in progress.

AB Research on learning dashboards aims to identify what data is meaningful to different stakeholders in education, and how data can be presented to support sense-making processes. This paper summarizes the main outcomes of a systematic literature review on learning dashboards, in the fields of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining The query was run in five main academic databases and enriched with papers coming from GScholar, resulting in 346 papers out of which 55 were included in the final analysis. Our review distinguishes different kinds of research studies as well as different aspects of learning dashboards and their maturity in terms of evaluation. As the research field is still relatively young, many of the studies are exploratory and proof-of-concept. Among the main open issues and future lines of work in the area of learning dashboards, we identify the need for longitudinal research in authentic settings, as well as studies that systematically compare different dashboard design options.

AB The International Workshop of Smart Environments and Analytics on Video-Based Learning (SE@VBL) aims to connect research efforts on Video-Based Learning with Smart Environments and Analytics to create synergies between these fields. The main objective is to build a research community around the intersection of these topical areas. In particular, SE@VBL aims to develop a critical discussion about the next generation of video-based learning environments and their analytics, the form of these analytics and the way they can be analyzed in order to help us to better understand and improve the value of educational videos to support teaching and learning. SE@VBL is based on the rationale that combining and analyzing learners' interactions with other available data obtained from learners, new avenues for research on video-based learning have emerged. This can have a significant impact in current educational trends such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Flipped Classroom.

DE Learning analytics; education; e-learning system
AB Learning Analytics can provide many opportunities for improving learning experience and performance in higher education. In addition to grades, many other data can be collected and analysed during the teaching-learning process. E-learning systems seems to be the easiest mean of collecting learning related data. Although e-learning system are already widely used in higher education, learning analytics solution are still not implemented. The purpose of the current research is to explore what can be reasons behind this phenomenon, how much teachers are aware of student learning analytics related expectations and which elements and points of learning analysis should be included in a blended learning training. A pilot course will be launched in the Moodie e-learning system. Most of the data recorded by the system - like data concerning time spent with reading course materials, assignment scores, or self-evaluation test results etc can be relevant for learning analysis. The question is how to apply this data in a meaningful and reasonable manner. Our aim is to develop and demonstrate the use of a learning analytics framework for evaluating the learning outcomes of a particular course.
   In order to exploit the benefits of learning analytics an integrated toolset must be developed that can identify, collect and then process data based on the various requirements. In this research high emphasis will be put on visualization solutions (e.g.: Knowledge Network, Workflow Dashboards and Rankings) for supporting students and teachers too.

DE Open Data; Problem Based Learning; Learning Analytics
AB Open Data initiatives worldwide are boosting with an aim to increase transparency and contribute to economic growth. With a global annual economic potential value estimated to $3 trillion, this boost seems justified. Current progress however is not satisfactory. We believe a main reason is the lack of relevant skills and competencies. Current education and training activities are scarce and do not exploit practice-oriented learning methods such as Problem Based Learning (PBL) or novel assessment opportunities such as Learning Analytics (LA). As a result, stakeholders are missing skills related to publishing and reusing Open Data. The aim of this tutorial is to introduce to the audience Open Data education and training based on the PBL strategy and by exploiting LA for performance assessment. We will present a curriculum structure and learning content on Open Data for academia, business and the public sector that can be reused by all interested stakeholders. We will also demonstrate a university and a VET course model that have been designed in order to facilitate innovative and data-driven Open Data education and training. Finally, we will share lessons learnt from the practical application of the above in universities and businesses across multiple European countries.

AB Despite the ubiquity of learning in workplace and professional settings, the learning analytics (LA) community has paid significant attention to such settings only recently. This may be due to the focus on researching formal learning, as workplace learning is often informal, hard to grasp, and not unequivocally defined. This article summarizes the state of the art of workplace learning analytics (WPLA), extracted from a two-iteration systematic literature review. Our in-depth analysis of 52 existing proposals not only provides a descriptive view of the field, but also reflects on researcher conceptions of learning and their influence on the design, analytics, and technology choices made in this area. We also discuss the characteristics of workplace learning that make WPLA proposals different from LA in formal education contexts and the challenges resulting from this. We found that WPLA is gaining momentum, especially in some fields, like healthcare and education. The focus on theory is generally a positive feature in WPLA, but we encourage a stronger focus on assessing the impact of WPLA in realistic settings.

AB Over the past decade, the increasing use of learning analytics opened the possibility of making data-driven decisions for improving student learning. Driven by the strong university adoption of learning analytics, most early learning analytics research focused on issues specific to tertiary education. With the broader adoption of educational technologies in primary and secondary education and the emergence of new classroom-focused technologies, there has been a growing awareness of the potentials of learning analytics for supporting students and diagnosing their learning progress in pre-university contexts. This special section focused on investigating, developing, and evaluating state-of-the-art learning analytics approaches within primary and secondary school settings. In this editorial, we summarize the papers of the special section and discuss the challenges and opportunities for learning analytics within the school context. We conclude with the discussion around the opportunities for future work and the implications of this special section for the field of learning analytics.

DE Learning analytics; MOOC; Self-regulated learning
AB Nowadays, the digital learning environment has revolutionized the vision of distance learning course delivery and drastically transformed the online educational system. The emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has exposed web technology used in education in a more advanced revolution ushering a new generation of learning environments. The digital learning environment is expected to augment the real-world conventional education setting. The educational pedagogy is tailored with the standard practice which has been noticed to increase student success in MOOCs and provide a revolutionary way of self-regulated learning. However, there are still unresolved questions relating to the understanding of learning analytics data and how this could be implemented in educational contexts to support individual learning. One of the major issues in MOOCs is the consistent high dropout rate which over time has seen courses recorded less than 20% completion rate. This paper explores learning analytics from different perspectives in a MOOC context. First, we review existing literature relating to learning analytics in MOOCs, bringing together findings and analyses from several courses. We explore meta-analysis of the basic factors that correlate to learning analytics and the significant in improving education. Second, using themes emerging from the previous study, we propose a preliminary model consisting of four factors of learning analytics. Finally, we provide a framework of learning analytics based on the following dimensions: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive, suggesting how the factors could be applied in a MOOC context. Our exploratory framework indicates the need for engaging learners and providing the understanding of how to support and help participants at risk of dropping out of the course.

AB Computer-assisted language learning (CALL) is often used as an approach to foreign language teaching and learning in higher education. The CALL course is offered at a national university in Japan to allow freshman students to perform self-regulated learning with e-learning materials for the purpose of developing language skills. However, as novice self-regulated learners, freshman students have low self-regulation skills and they are more likely to obtain lower achievement. In addition, it is difficult for instructors to grasp students' learning situation due to the large amount of evaluation work. Therefore, in this research, a total of 7,413,397 learning logs were analyzed, which were collected from 2,499 students' learning interactions in the CALL course. After that, a learning support system for freshman students is proposed. The system is provided for students and instructors through the learning dashboard. On the one hand, students can conduct self-monitoring and reflect their behaviors in a visual way. On the other hand, instructors can identify learning behavioral patterns and grasp individual learning situation to provide one-on-one instructions.

AB The motivation for this paper is derived from the fact that there has been increasing interest among researchers and practitioners in developing technologies that capture, model and analyze learning and teaching experiences that take place beyond computer-based learning environments. In this paper, we review case studies of tools and technologies developed to collect and analyze data in educational settings, quantify learning and teaching processes and support assessment of learning and teaching in an automated fashion. We focus on pipelines that leverage information and data harnessed from physical spaces and/or integrates collected data across physical and digital spaces. Our review reveals a promising field of physical classroom analysis. We describe some trends and suggest potential future directions. Specifically, more research should be geared towards a) deployable and sustainable data collection set-ups in physical learning environments, b) teacher assessment, c) developing feedback and visualization systems and d) promoting inclusivity and generalizability of models across populations.

AB Several governments across the world have temporarily closed educational institutions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, numerous universities have seen a growing trend towards online learning scenarios. Thus, learning takes place not just within a person, but within and across the networks. However, the current implementations of open learning scenarios are facing many challenges, including: a) there is no systematic feature to track, evaluate and report the online learning activities of students; b) lack of immediacy and personal feedback; and c) lack of self-reflection. Consequently, Learning Analytics (LA) is one of the most distinguished solutions to address these challenges. In this study, the two kinds of LA dashboard, behavioral and cognitive, have been investigated. The methodological approach taken in this investigation was adopted from a design-based research framework, which blends empirical educational research with the theory-driven design of online learning environments. The initial sample consisted of 320 undergraduate nursing students. The cohort was divided into two groups according to the two types of LA dashboard. The findings have argued that behavioral dashboards took precedence over data evaluation items, while cognitive dashboards had the advantage in achieving the goals of LA - e.g., awareness, self-reflection, and impact on learning process.

AB Open learning analytics (OLA) aims to meet diversified needs for insights into different stakeholders' efforts to improve learning and learning contexts integrating heterogeneous learning analytics techniques. From an abstract point of view, OLA aligns well with the ideas of open and distance education institutions, of which Shanghai Open University (SOU) is a learning Chinese representative. The paper reports on the design of an OLA framework for SOU, based on different users' service demands and the diverse sources of data and multiple platforms in use at the university. The proposed architecture is based on a discussion of the general characteristics of OLA architecture. The final model is achieved through an iterative development method.

ID MODEL
AB Accurate and timely measurement of learning engagement is crucial for the application of precision education. At the same time, it is still a central research theme, both in the learning analytics community as in the broader area of educational research. 'Engagement is one of the hottest research topics in the field of educational psychology' is for a good reason the opening sentence of a recent special issue. In our contribution, we propose a holistic approach to the measurement of engagement by integrating data of behavioral type through traces of learning processes captured from log files into affective, behavioral, and cognitive measures of engagement collected with surveys and cognitive measures from assessments for and as learning. We apply this holistic approach in an empirical analysis of dispositional learning analytics. Starting from four different engagement profiles created by two-step clustering, we find that these profiles primarily differ in their timing of engagement with learning. Next, we develop regression-based prediction models that make clear that trace, survey, and assessment data have complementary roles in signaling students at risk for failure and are all three crucial constituents of prediction equations that differ in the timing of learning feedback.

AB In this study, students' behavioral patterns in an educational game were investigated by conducting a digital game-based learning activity in an elementary school science course. Moreover, the behavioral patterns of the high achievement and low-achievement students were compared to explore the possible educational gaming behavioral patterns affecting the students' learning achievements. It was found that the high-achievement students showed more deep thinking and reflective behavioral patterns than the low-achievement ones, implying the necessity of incorporating learning strategies to guide students to have deep thinking and reflective behaviors during the digital game-based learning process. The finding of this study provides a good reference for researchers and school teachers who intend to employ the digital game-based learning approach.

DE Learning analytics; Digital textbook
AB In South Korea, classes are currently using digital textbooks in pilot schools. Digital textbooks are open media which not only provide learning content and materials in a flexible manner according to individual learning levels and styles but also enable easy connection to external third-party tools, using various devices (mobile, PC, etc.) and cloud computing environment.
   In the conventional educational field, most data related to learning activity disappear when education is over. However, in digital textbook-based class, various forms of learning activity data can be collected, used, and analyzed thanks to the use of on-line lesson tools. In this background, we commenced this research to improve the learning environment through analysis of data stored in this way.
   IMS Global proposes the Caliper Framework[1] to measure and analyze student achievements. The Caliper Framework has the structure of collecting data generated mostly from online learning system, which is central to e-Learning activity like LMS, through the standard Sensor API and assessing the data through metrics that can measure the data. However, this framework is limited in its application to Korea's K12 digital textbook-based education environment: In this environment, we should collect and analyze learning activity data from classes using online learning tools that are diversely dispersed in classroom-centered, not online-centered, lessons.
   Therefore, we need to develop an analysis platform which will enable comprehensive assessment of various forms of data generated from in-class educational process, including the use of digital textbooks, participation in learning communities, digital textbook content, and evaluation by teachers.
   Our research includes methods of collecting and storing data for analysis of teaching and learning achievements from these various and unprepared data for analysis. We design and implement a system that collects, analyzes, and visualizes data through stages of data collector, pre-processor (three-level metric generator), analyzer, and visualizer.
   In this paper, we describe methods of extracting metric data that can be used for analysis from various forms of data generated without considering learning analysis in the pre-processing phase. We divided this process into three levels in a systematic manner.
   The first level metric is data collectable through queries of data to be collected. We add a timestamp to non-standard data collected from diverse systems if necessary and accumulate the data in mongoDB as log data. The first level metric refers to data set that can be generated through queries of the accumulated log data.
   The second level metric refers to data that can be generated by applying simple forms of statistical functions to data set gained as the result of the first level metric. For example, such statistical functions as total sum, count, average, and min/max value can be used.
   The third level metric refers to data set developed by applying multi-dimensional data conversion and data mining techniques from the data extracted not just from the first and second level metrics but also from other third level metric. Algorithm that can be used in extracting the third level metric may include similarity analysis through duration-based pattern matching and data mining. These third level metric data can be used to analyze whether students have planned patterns of learning activity based on their plans and self-directed learning skills.

AB In recent ears, several tools to support learning processes have emerged from the research on Learning Analytics (LA). However, little attention has been given to the contexts where learning takes place, and to the stakeholders involved in implementing and using these tools. Following the SHEILA Framework, we present the results of interviews and focus groups with students from a Brazilian public university on their perceptions of the potential and risks of using LA in higher education. Findings indicate great difficulties to use the Learning Management System; lack of effective communication with teaching staff; lack of quality and timely feedback; high perceived value of personalization; rejection of competition and rankings; issues with self-confidence; and trustworthiness of the educational institution. From the analysis of students' perspectives, we point to opportunities to use LA in the context of a Brazilian public university.

AB Digitalisation in education is inevitable and must be driven forward even more consistently. Accordingly, the current COVID 19 pandemic further underlines and accelerates this necessity. Instead of persistently philosophising about infrastructure and learning platforms, teachers and students are suddenly confronted directly with digital teaching and e-learning. Among technologies for digitalization there is one with a huge potential in the course of digitalisation in education, namely Virtual Reality (VR). VR can be applied as a powerful and multifunctional tool for accessing problems usually considered as hard to taggle. For education, VR can create a connection between abstract theory and real-world scenarios and makes the presentation of facts and applications tangible for students. In addition to a theoretical and literature-based consideration of VR in the concepts of e-learning and blended learning, this paper presents the integration of learning content based on VR through the LMS platform OPAL and discusses the achieved results. Linking to this, an additional chapter will discuss the promotion of the learning process through an immersive learning environment, i.e., what opportunities and challenges arise. The idea and implementation of a virtual research lab modelled based on the physical Industry 4.0 research lab by Professor Christoph Laroque and his Team Industry Analytics is intended to highlight the possibilities and potential of an immersive environment and provide an outlook for future work. This paper addresses the questions to what extent and in which context an immersive learning environment can be more effective than traditional face-to-face learning environments in courses and seminars. Furthermore, challenges and difficulties regarding the use of immersive learning environments from the projects experience will be described. Thoughts and ideas on how these challenges and difficulties can be overcome sum up the considerations within this paper.

AB It is challenging to utilize learning analytic technologies to examine gameplay log data for game-embedded assessment in the field of game-based learning. Analytical approaches based on a new perspective focusing on complicated contextual data are imperative in the current scenario. A relatively new concept called precision education, which focuses on individual learning and provides personalized and timely intervention to different learners, can be regarded as a new perspective for game-based learning. Additionally, the order of knowledge acquisition in the learning environment is a kind of learning path extracted from the contextual information of in-game behavior logs. Therefore, in this study, the authors propose a new analytical approach to identify learning path patterns and elucidate the features of these patterns for an educational game they developed. The statistical analysis shows that learners with diverse learning path patterns have different learning effects, suggesting that the learning path is an important factor in precision education. The practice of using the explanation method to examine the proposed approach can help us understand learners' knowledge acquisition and provide evidence for enhancing the accuracy of precision education and improving the quality of the educational game. The findings are expected to contribute to both game-based learning and precision education.

AB Online learning with the characteristics of flexibility and autonomy has become a widespread and popular mode of higher education in which students need to engage in self-regulated learning (SRL) to achieve success. The purpose of this study is to utilize clickstream data to reveal the time management of SRL. This study adopts learning analytics to investigate the differences in time management (time investment and time use patterns) in a large-scale authentic online learning environment based on 8019 students' clickstream data of over one term recorded by the starC system log. This study quantitatively reveals the SRL process in a higher education online learning environment, which presents the detailed differences in time management among students with different academic performance categories. These research results will have inspirations in the design of SRL interventions for optimizing students' learning processes and overall achievement.

AB The users of the World Wide Web produce data continuously. This happens in varied areas such as trading on line, product ratings, support and use of services, and many more, comprising Distance Education. The ever increasing amount of such data can make analysis and extraction of meaningful information progressively harder, and sophisticated analysis techniques are to be used to extract added value from data. Many companies do collection and analysis of data with the purpose to develop their marketing strategies. In the field of education, and Distance Education in particular, data collected through online Learning Management Systems (LMSs) can provide a great resource, and a strong challenge, for the analysis of learning processes, the design of training paths, and the updating and personalization of learning environments. While, on the one hand, there is an increasing demand by educational institutions to measure, demonstrate, and improve the results achieved in distance learning, on the other hand the logic of traditional reporting included in LMS platforms does not satisfy that growing need. Learning Analytics is the answer to the need for optimization of learning through the techniques of analysis of data produced by learning processes, involving all stakeholders of the system. In this paper we show and discuss a brief state of the art of models of Learning Analytics presented in the literature.

AB Learning Analytics has a significant impact on the learning and teaching processes. These can be improved by exploiting the already available data extracted from the activity of the students at the distance learning platforms. This work gives an overview of Learning Analytics and presents their objectives and some illustrative examples of their potential contributions to the better understanding of learning. We provide a framework for analyzing learning based on following dimensions: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive, suggesting how the factors might be applied in an e-learning context. It is therefore necessary to involve the learners and understand how to support and help participants who are at risk of dropping out of the course.

AB While the technology-rich classroom makes it comparatively easy to gather, store and access data on students' activities, turning those into information on learning that can inform pedagogical decision-making is still hard to achieve. In the NEXT-TELL project, we build on concepts from educational assessment design and on modeling concepts from computer science as a basis for generating quality data on students' learning. We describe a set of inter-related methods and software components that can be used to turn assessments into support mechanisms for learning, and to make use and sense of data for improving teaching and learning.

AB This paper treats activities of a research project about IoT (Internet of Things) security education. In this project, the authors plan to provide SPOC (Small Private Online Course), MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) and education games (serious games) about IoT security. One of the key challenges is the development of educational materials related to IoT security. As the first activity of the project, the authors are building a comprehensive database regarding various kinds of IoT threats based on Linked Data, and also developing an authoring tool that enables professors/teachers to easily make educational materials about IoT security using the database. As its second activity, the authors are developing a web-based material viewer supporting learning analytics. For learning analytics, the web-based material viewer should have the functionality to collect learners' activity data and to store them in a database. The authors have already proposed two visualization tools for learning analytics for such data. So, in this paper, the authors propose a learning analytics framework for IoT security education as the integration of the authoring tool based on Linked Data, the web-based material viewer supporting learning analytics and the visualization tools for learning analytics.

AB The proliferation of tools that support e-learning can be an impediment to many practitioners who often feel intimidated by the sheer range available. The unintended consequence is that many delivery platforms end up being used unproductively often as an information dump.
   Where e-learning is attempted it often follows a transmission of knowledge approach, which focuses on the lower levels of abstraction, factual or procedural knowledge which is information heavy but action light. This approach rewards passivity in students rather than active involvement and as a consequence has less chance of developing higher level cognitive abilities which are usually stated in learning objectives.
   This fails students who arrive on campus brimming with creativity and curiosity, are active learners and problem solvers who demand new ways of learning.
   JISC Netskills together with a consortium of initial teacher training colleges in North East England have been involved in the design and development of a series of enhanced e-learning modules. These have been constructed to incorporate higher level learning in the Initial Teacher Training and Certificate in Education teacher training courses which will complement existing face to face delivery to produce a blended solution.
   The aim was to replace passive e-learning through a developmental approach which seeks to engage students in active, challenging and engaging learning using realistic, real-world, scenario and action based e-learning, underpinned by the development of enquiry, problem solving and team working skills.
   The resultant e-learning modules use action based learning to engaging and immerse learners in an underlying, investigative storyline leading to problem solving activities that encourage the application of analytical, evaluative, creative and critical thinking skills.
   In addition this approach enables a range of technological tools to be seamlessly integrated into the elearning at appropriate times all underpinned by a clear learning rationale. The guided and strategic use of tools such as blogs, wikis, e-portfolios, discussion boards and live chat to underpin the modules at appropriate times combine educationally effective e-learning approaches and use of technology to properly enhance learning.
   Whilst this project is situated in the area of teacher training the approach, where technology is driven by teaching and learning underpinned by relevant theory, is universal and can be applied in any curriculum area

AB The use of mobile devices, including mobile phones and tablets, is a growing trend in education. Widespread access to mobile devices and the opportunity to learn regardless of time and place make mobile learning an important tool for lifelong learning. Nevertheless m-learning is still in its infancy and great efforts need to be done so as to investigate the potentials of an educational paradigm shift from the traditional one-size-fits-all teaching approaches to adaptive and personalized learning that can be delivered via mobile devices. In order to achieve this, an extensive review of literature will need to be conducted to define a framework that supports both design and delivery approaches of the learning design via the model of flipped classroom, using case-based learning. Some other factors that need to be examined include the adaptation and management of the content produced and acquired, as well as the link between mobile device affordances and learning methodologies. In this work we define certain areas that can help define such a framework and propose an architecture that can help incorporate and evaluate them.

AB Educational applications, in general, treat disparate study threads as a singular entity, bundle pedagogical intervention and other student support services at a coarser level, and summatively assess final products of assessments. In this research, we propose an analytics framework where we closely monitor individual threads of study habits and assess study threads in an individual fashion to trace learning processes leading into assessment products. We developed customized intervention to target specific skills and nurture optimal study habits. The framework has been implemented in a system called SCALE (Smart Causal Analytics on LEaming). SCALE enables the tracking of students' individual study threads towards multiple final study products. The large volume, multiple variety, and incessant flow of data classifies our work in the realms of big data analytics. We conducted a preliminary study using SCALE. The results show the ability of the system to track the evolution of competencies. We propose that explicitly supporting the development of a targeted set of competencies is one of the key tenets of Smart Learning Environments.

AB This paper presents MILA, a prototype interactive Learning Analytics tool for the Moodle learning management system that has been developed to support the analysis and improvement of the teaching and learning processes in the e-learning environment of the University of Rome Unitelma Sapienza. MILA offers a variety of interactive and real-time data visualizations that provide statistics, trends, and insight information both on the Moodle-based virtual learning environment as a whole, and on each course included in it. In addition to Moodle standard logs, MILA is able to analyze tracking data generated by SCORM-compliant learning objects and to measure the duration of the related user sessions. Although MILA has been developed as a Moodle plugin, its software architecture and analysis models can be re-used and adapted to develop a learning analytics tool for any SCORM-compliant learning management system.

AB With the continuous development of online learning platforms, educational data analytics and prediction have become a promising research field, which are helpful for the development of personalized learning system. However, the indicator's selection process does not combine with the whole learning process, which may affect the accuracy of prediction results. In this paper, we induce 19 behavior indicators in the online learning platform, proposing a student performance prediction model which combines with the whole learning process. The model consists of four parts: data collection and pre-processing, learning behavior analytics, algorithm model building and prediction. Moreover, we apply an optimized Logistic Regression algorithm, taking a case to analyze students' behavior and to predict their performance. Experimental results demonstrate that these eigenvalues can effectively predict whether a student was probably to have an excellent grade.

AB The growing adoption of learning analytics (LA) approaches and data mining (DM) techniques using educational gamification data sets is reflected in increased publications on this topic. However, with different gamified contexts and a variety of LA methods available, no comprehensive review summarized the obtained findings. Therefore, this research aims to identify studies' characteristics, objectives, and methods used in gamification learning analytics (GaLA) research. To identify these, this study comprehensively reviewed the literature of 24 studies selected from an initial pool of 221 search results. The findings show that GaLA methods can be categorized into: visualization, data mining, social network analysis (SNA), statistics, and correlations. In conclusion, GaLA is defined as a data-driven approach using various methods of data analysis and mining techniques in gamified contexts for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data to assess or enhance the gameful experience, understand student behaviour, and improve learning outcomes.

AB Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) innovations are commonly aimed at supporting learners in physical learning spaces through state-of-the-art sensing technologies and analysis techniques. Although a growing body of MMLA research has demonstrated the potential benefits of sensor-based technologies in education, whether their use can be scalable, sustainable, and ethical remains questionable. Such uncertainty can limit future research and the potential adoption of MMLA by educational stakeholders in authentic learning situations. To address this, we systematically reviewed the methodological, operational, and ethical challenges faced by current MMLA works that can affect the scalability and sustainability of future MMLA innovations. A total of 96 peer-reviewed articles published after 2010 were included. The findings were summarised into three recommendations, including i) improving reporting standards by including sufficient details about sensors, analysis techniques, and the full disclosure of evaluation metrics, ii) fostering interdisciplinary collaborations among experts in learning analytics, software, and hardware engineering to develop affordable sensors and upgrade MMLA innovations that used discontinued technologies, and iii) developing ethical guidelines to address the potential risks of bias, privacy, and equality concerns with using MMLA innovations. Through these future research directions, MMLA can remain relevant and eventually have actual impacts on educational practices.

AB In ubiquitous learning, authentic experiences are captured and later reused as those are rich resources for foreign vocabulary development. This article presents an experiential theory-oriented approach to the design of learning analytics support for sharing and reusing authentic experiences. In this regard, first, a conceptual framework to support vocabulary learning using learners' authentic experiences is proposed. Next, learning experiences are captured using a context-aware ubiquitous learning system. Finally, grounded in the theoretical framework, the development of a web-based tool called learn from others (LFO) panel is presented. The LFO panel analyzes various learning logs (authentic, partially-authentic, and words) using the profiling method while determining the top-five learning partners inside a seamless learning analytics platform. This article contributes to the research in the area of theory-oriented design of learning analytics for vocabulary learning through authentic activities and focuses on closing the loops of experiential learning using learning analytics cycles.

AB In this paper, we present the results of an exploratory study in which the requirements and (conflicting) interests of the various stakeholders regarding the development and implementation of Learning Analytics applications are discussed. Furthermore, we explain how they relate to the process of Learning Analytics, for which a new model is presented. The findings, based on a workshop with various stakeholders, demonstrate that interests clash in the areas of privacy, data ownership, trust and interference, the prevailing educational culture, standards and interoperability, competition and regulation. The biggest obstacles arise in the fields of privacy and data ownership. Personal data enables better services and innovation from producers of learning materials and Learning Tracking Systems. However, learners and their parents are expected to demand control over their personal data. This calls for the application of the 'privacy by design' principle. Another important topic is human-machine interaction: the degree of autonomy of a Learning Analytics application, and the implications for the teacher's role in the learning process.

AB Learning analytics (LA) and group awareness tools are regarded as top priorities for research in the field of computer-supported collaborative learning. As such, this study investigated whether LA-enabled group awareness information facilitates wiki-supported collaborative learning in secondary education. We proposed an analytic framework of measures for assessing collaboration quality in a wiki-based collaborative learning environment, covering student contribution, participation, transactivity, and social dynamics. Based on this framework, we designed an LA-enabled group awareness tool, Wikiglass, for use by both teachers and students in K-12 schools for visualizing statistics of students' input and interactions on wikis at the class, group, and individual levels. Adopting a naturalistic design, this study allowed teachers and students to decide whether and how often to use the tool. System logs from wikis and Wikiglass and interview data were collected from 440 students and six teachers involved in semester-long wiki-supported group inquiry projects in a secondary school. Regression analyses of quantitative data and thematic content analysis of interview responses showed relationships between the frequencies of teachers' and students' use of Wikiglass and measures of students' collaboration quality at both the individual and group levels. These results indicate that teachers' scaffolding, students' collaboration styles, and ethical issues must all be considered when implementing collaborative learning approaches for secondary education. We also discuss the implications of our results for research and practice in the application of LA and group awareness tools for enhancing wiki-supported collaborative learning in K-12 education.

AB Many previous studies have shown that students' learning strategies and engagement are both important factors affecting students' learning outcome. We want to know whether the engagement of students who use different learning strategies is different, so that we can proxy measure students' engagement according to the learning strategies used by students. Different from the past methods of using questionnaires or interviews, this research used education data mining technology to directly analyze the learning logs of online learning system to extract students' learning strategies. We collected the learning logs of 56 students, and extracted the learning strategies of the students using sequence clustering. We classified four learning strategies and performed Pearson correlation analysis with students' learning outcome and engagement, and discussed the key strategies that affect students' learning outcome. We also found that students who use different learning strategies have different levels of engagement.

ID DESIGN; NUMBERS
AB Learning analytics has the potential to impact student learning, at scale. Embedded in that claim are a set of assumptions and tensions around the nature of scale, impact on student learning, and the scope of infrastructure encompassed by 'learning analytics' as a socio-technical field. Drawing on our design experience of developing learning analytics and inducting others into its use, we present a model that we have used to address five key challenges we have encountered. In developing this model, we recommend: A focus on impact on learning through augmentation of existing practice; the centrality of tasks in implementing learning analytics for impact on learning; the commensurate centrality of learning in evaluating learning analytics; inclusion of co-design approaches in implementing learning analytics across sites; and an attention to both social and technical infrastructure.

AB Based on the educational data published under Creative Commons License, this study describes about the performance prediction experiment applied with four types of machine learning algorithms, including the deep learning algorithm, and examines how the prediction accuracy is affected depending on the selected feature quantities. The aim of this paper is to compare method selection and feature selection in terms of their ability to improve the prediction results. In data analysis by machine learning or deep learning, the determinant of result is often unclear. In the field of learning analytics, analysis can be performed even if the amount of data is small compared to the field of image recognition. Therefore, it is meaningful to compare analysis accuracy using machine learning and deep learning and to examine which method is most effective for prediction academic performance. In this research, we revealed that Deep Learning has the best method for Learning Analytics. Also, the results of this study indicate that feature selection is more important for improvement to prediction rather than method selection.

AB While there is high potential in using learning analytics to provide educational institutions as well as teachers and learners with actionable information and improve learning experiences, currently only very few learning analytics tools are actually used in educational institutions. In this paper, we introduce MORPH, a platform that facilitates the integration of learning analytics modules and tools into institutional learning systems. MORPH provides a robust distributed architecture which combines batch, stream and real-time data processing using a parallel processing model to enable and support efficient processing of large amounts of data. Furthermore, it provides common management and administration features that enable the seamless integration of learning analytics research modules and tools into existing institutional learning systems.

AB The concept map has a positive effect on the enhancement of self-regulated learning (SRL) and learning performance in terms of cognitive learning tools, according to previous research. However, the relationships between knowledge construction state, learning behaviors, psychological state, and learning performance have not been clearly investigated. Learning analytics (LA) can play an important role in addressing the issue of collecting learning behaviors. This study aims to investigate the relationships between them, using the LA approach. The results indicated that seven knowledge construction types were detected, and knowledge construction type had significant differences in performance, albeit no significant differences in the Tukey post-hoc analyses. Moreover, there is a significant correlation between knowledge map cluster and discussion, some of the factors of SRL (e.g., declarative knowledge, monitoring), and some learning behaviors, such as adding marker, memo, and red marker.

ID STRATEGIES
AB Several tools to support learning processes based on educational data have emerged from research on Learning Analytics (LA) in the last few years. These tools aim to support students and instructors in daily activities, and academic managers in making institutional decisions. Although the adoption of LA tools is spreading, the field still needs to deepen the understanding of the contexts where learning takes place, and of the views of the stakeholders involved in implementing and using these tools. In this sense, the SHEILA framework proposes a set of instruments to perform a detailed analysis of the expectations and needs of different stakeholders in higher education institutions, regarding the adoption of LA. Moreover, there is a lacuna in research on stakeholders' expectations from LA outside the Global North. Therefore, this paper reports on the findings of the application of interviews and focus groups, based on the SHEILA framework, with students and teaching staff from a Brazilian public university, to investigate their perceptions of the potential benefits and risks of using LA in higher education in the country. Findings indicate that there is a high interest in using LA for improving the learning experience, in particular, being able to provide personalized feedback, to adapt teaching practices to students' needs, and to make evidence-based pedagogical decisions. From the analysis of these perspectives, we point to opportunities for using LA in Brazilian higher education.

ID DESIGN
AB Project-based learning (PjBL) is a promising approach for supporting learning of computer programming by addressing the gap between the attainment of abstract knowledge and the application of this knowledge to authentic programming tasks. The World Wide Web has considerable potential to expand and improve PjBL environments. However, making implicit aspects of a programming task accessible to learners and instructors to support reflection and improvement can be challenging. This paper discusses the challenge of PjBL in programming education and outlines a set of key aspects and an analysis framework to inform design and analysis of PjBL programming in web-based environments, by exploiting the emerging field of Teaching and Learning Analytics. Based on the proposed analysis framework, the design of an empirical study is outlined, capitalizing on a novel web-based PjBL environment that makes complex cognitive processes accessible and affords the analysis of its effects on learning programming in multiple aspects.

TI The use of learning analytics and the potential risk of harm for K-12
   students participating in digital learning environments
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Learning analytics; Digital learning; Ethics
AB This paper is in response to the manuscript titled "Ethical oversight of student data in learning analytics: A typology derived from a cross-continental, cross-institutional perspective" (Willis et al. in Educ Technol Res Dev 66(4):1029-1049, 2016). The response is from a K-12 educational environment perspective. Willis, Slade, and Prinsloo's typology of different ethical approaches to learning analytics adds value to the special issue topic of shifting to digital as it provides different ways to view learning analytics as well as the type of approval(s) possibly needed for each view. K-12 educational institutions can utilize the manuscript as a starting place for review of their ethical oversights when analyzing student data as more schools are shifting to digital. A limitation of Willis, Slade, and Prinsloo's manuscript in supporting the shift to digital is that the manuscript was published before the overwhelming shift to digital was mandated as a result of Covid-19. Future work related to the manuscript and with a focus on the K-12 educational environment could include K-12 education agencies deriving a K-12 specific typology from a review of ethical oversight protocols or analyzing the effects of the shift to digital in K-12 on the original typology. During the 2020 pandemic, K-12 schools in the United States moved to digital learning quickly and in large numbers. This move has resulted in a wealth of digital learning analytics available to be used in improving student learning outcomes. However, local education agencies must first make sure they have a clear framework for oversight of how digital learning analytics will be used. K-12 students are at risk of harm if local education agencies do not stop and carefully reflect on the potential risks to students resulting from decisions made as a result of using digital learning analytics.

DE Learning analytics; real-time systems; instructor-centered design
AB Learning analytics systems have the potential to bring enormous value to online education. Unfortunately, many instructors and platforms do not adequately leverage learning analytics in their courses today. In this paper, we report on the value of these systems from the perspective of course instructors. We study these ideas through OARS, a modular and real-time learning analytics system that we deployed across more than ten online courses with tens of thousands of learners. We leverage this system as a starting point for semi-structured interviews with a diverse set of instructors. Our study suggests new design goals for learning analytics systems, the importance of real-time analytics to many instructors, and the value of flexibility in data selection and aggregation for an instructor when working with an analytics system.

AB Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have been tremendously spreading among Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) academic disciplines. These MOOCs have served an agglomeration of various learner groups across the world. The leading MOOCs platform in Austria, the iMooX, offers such courses. This paper highlights authors' experience of applying Learning Analytics to examine the participation of secondary school pupils in one of its courses called "Mechanics in everyday life". We sighted different patterns and observations and on the contrary of the expected jubilant results of any educational MOOC, we will show, that pupils seemingly decided to consider it not as a real motivating learning route, but rather as an optional homework.

AB During the COVID-19 pandemic, most education has been conducted through online classes. While feedback and interaction between students and instructors are significant in programming education or engineering practice, online education today cannot satisfy these aspects of learning. Therefore, this study proposes a learning support system for programming education and presents the results of designing and implementing this system. The proposed system consists of an online development environment module, a learning monitoring module, and a learning support module. It also provides a web-based programming environment, real-time chat and code mirroring, error guide messages and related lectures, e-learning quizzes, and learning activity analysis features. The system standardizes the development environment between the instructor and students, helps students take the initiative in solving errors, and enables code-oriented interactions between the instructor and students. It also collects data from all learning situations in the database. Conducting a big data analysis with the collected data will enable individual guidance for students by finding errors that frequently occur in programming and recommending learning materials to solve them.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Little is known about the processes institutions use when discerning their readiness to implement learning analytics. This study aims to address this gap in the literature by using survey data from the beta version of the Learning Analytics Readiness Instrument (LARI) [1]. Twenty-four institutions were surveyed and 560 respondents participated. Five distinct factors were identified from a factor analysis of the results: Culture; Data Management Expertise; Data Analysis Expertise; Communication and Policy Application; and, Training. Data were analyzed using both the role of those completing the survey and the Carnegie classification of the institutions as lenses. Generally, information technology professionals and institutions classified as Research Universities-Very High research activity had significantly different scores on the identified factors. Working within a framework of organizational learning, this paper details the concept of readiness as a reflective process, as well as how the implementation and application of analytics should be done so with ethical considerations in mind. Limitations of the study, as well as next steps for research in this area, are also discussed.

AB It has been long argued that learning analytics has the potential to act as a "middle space" between the learning sciences and data analytics, creating technical possibilities for exploring the vast amount of data generated in online learning environments. One common learning analytics intervention is the learning dashboard, a support tool for teachers and learners alike that allows them to gain insight into the learning process. Although several related works have scrutinised the state-of-the-art in the field of learning dashboards, none have addressed the theoretical foundation that should inform the design of such interventions. In this systematic literature review, we analyse the extent to which theories and models from learning sciences have been integrated into the development of learning dashboards aimed at learners. Our critical examination reveals the most common educational concepts and the context in which they have been applied. We find evidence that current designs foster competition between learners rather than knowledge mastery, offering misguided frames of reference for comparison.

DE Learning Analytics; Service composition; Teacher-oriented
AB Modern education is benefitted from using Learning Management Systems (LMS) enabling automatic collection of large amount of data about students' activities, progress and results. However, currently there is a lack of enough means for teachers to effectively analyze and assess results from such data. This paper presents a research aiming to design and develop a new Learning Analytics (LA) solution which uses the existing LMS as distributed systems and storages of data through user-oriented services. It integrates the best features from LA and data visualization applications, from service composition platforms empower users to build complex business processes. Using teacher-oriented services data is retrieved directly from the relevant LMS as a response to educator's request and are visualized in appropriate way for fast and easy adoption. The paper describes the new approach and functionalities of this solution and ends with some challenges and conclusions.

DE learning analytics; information sources; learning platforms
AB In recent years, it has been a growing interest in the phenomenon of Learning Analytics. Most efforts have been focused on learning platforms, due to the huge amount of information they provide about student activity. However, as other authors also state, it is important to point out that much of this activity occurs beyond such platforms. This work aims at presenting a set of guidelines to select and combine several information sources in order to increase the impact and benefits of Learning Analytics. These guidelines have been applied to different experiences on two courses of the Bachelor Degree in Informatics Engineering.

AB Learning technologies enable interventions in the learning process aiming to improve learning. Learning analytics provides such interventions based on analysis of learner data, which are believed to have beneficial effects on both learning and the learning environment. Literature reporting on the effects of learning analytics interventions on learning allows us to assess in what way learning analytics improves learning. No standard set of operational definitions for learning affected by learning analytics interventions is available. We performed a systematic literature review of 1932 search hits, which yielded 62 key studies. We analyzed how affected learning was operationalized in these key studies and classified operational definitions into three categories: 1) learning environment; 2) learning process; and 3) learning outcome. A deepening analysis yielded a refined classification scheme with 11 subcategories. Most of the analyzed studies relate to either learning outcome or learning process. Only nine of the key studies relate to more than one category. Given the complex nature of applying learning analytics interventions in practice, measuring the effects on a wider spectrum of aspects can give more insight into the workings of learning analytics interventions on the different actors, processes, and outcomes involved. Based on the results of our review, we recommend making deliberate decisions on the (multiple) aspects of learning one tries to improve by applying learning analytics. Our refined classification with examples of operational definitions may help both academics and practitioners doing so, as it allows for a more structured, grounded, and comparable positioning of learning analytics benefits.

AB Learning styles cover various attributes related to the attitude and the learning behavior of individuals. Research and educational theories confirm that considering learning styles in distance learning environments can improve academic performance and learner satisfaction. The traditional approach to identify learning styles is based on asking students to fill out a questionnaire. This approach is considerably less accurate due to the learners' lack of awareness of their own preferences. Furthermore, learners' learning styles are defined only once. In this study, we propose an automatic approach to identify learners' learning styles based on patterns of learning behavior with respect to Felder and Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM), in an online learning environment. Patterns of behavior were analysed based on a data-driven approach. This approach exploits different Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect the learning styles of learners. To validate our proposals, experiments were carried out in a higher education institution with 73 students enrolled in online courses on the ADLS (Automatic Detection of Learning Styles) system that we implemented. A 9 runs cross-validation was used to evaluate the selected ML techniques. Detection accuracy, recall, precision, and F measure were observed. The findings show the possibility of detecting learning styles automatically based on learning behavior with high performances. Different levels of accuracy were found for the different dimensions of FSLSM. However, Support Vector Machines (SVM) have exhibited great ability in predicting learning styles for all dimensions of FSLSM with an accuracy average

AB The practice and application of education data mining and learning analytics has become the focus of educational researchers. However, it is still a difficult task to explore the law of group learning and the characteristics of individual learning. In this study, the online learning logs of 1,088 students from 22 classes were analyzed from the aspects of their login behaviors, resource utilization, quizzes, interactive behaviors, and academic achievement. To address these issues, multiple methods, including statistical analysis, visualization social network analysis and correlation analysis, were used to analyze the process and results of online learning. The results reveal the characteristics of group behavior of online learners and highlight the key factors that influence the learning process and outcomes of individual learners. From the view of students, these factors include the length and allocation of online time, the effective utilization of resources, social interaction, online learning support and services, etc. From the perspective of teachers, the factors include the management of online teaching, the appropriateness of learning resources, the effectiveness of online intervention strategies, the accurate feedback for online learners, etc. Therefore, learning analysis technology can not only standardize the assessment of learning outcomes, but can also focus more attention on the standardization of learning process assessment. It also identifies the main factors that affect the online learning outcomes and the group characteristics of online learners. At the same time, it provides the learners with personalized learning diagnosis reports which can both help learners understand their own learning status and promote instructors' accurate teaching and reasonable evaluation.

AB Social Learning Analytics (SLA) seeks to obtain hidden information in large amounts of data, usually of an educational nature. SLA focuses mainly on the analysis of social networks (Social Network Analysis, SNA) and the Web, to discover patterns of interaction and behavior of educational social actors. This paper incorporates the SLA in a smart classroom. Specifically, this paper proposes to determine the learning styles of the students in a smart classroom using SLA. In this proposal is analyzed external data from the web and social networks to build knowledge models about the students, in order to improve the learning processes that occur in the smart classrooms. In general, these SLA tasks will be organized in autonomous cycles, in order to integrate them with each other. The autonomic cycle will automate the execution of those tasks and the generation of knowledge models, in such a way to permanently monitor the learning process, observing it, analyzing it and determining the student learning styles. For the development of the SLA tasks, we will use concepts from the Semantic Mining, Text Mining, Data Mining, among other domains. Finally, we experiment in a test scenario, with results very interesting.

AB Nowadays, educators are facing very fast technological changes, incomparable professional pressure, to which one must add the challenge of working with students with different mindsets, expectations and needs. The educational environment is continuously changing to adjust to the needs and demands of our society. Therefore, most Higher Education Institutions (HEI) have developed evaluation approaches as part of their quality assurance programs. There has been growing concern over the use of learning analysis in HEI, where many of the followers suggest that developments in this area may be helpful to address several challenges that educators are facing. The application range of the learning analytics practice is broad and diverse, including the gain of better insight into how learning occurs, the possible identification of students at risk of dropping out, the improvement of passing rates, and the possibility of providing personalized learning.
   The purpose of the current paper is to describe an experiment to improve student engagement, educational achievement and the learning environment through a small private online course (SPOC). The paper also presents a description of the course structure and contents in a learning management system. The sample of this study, from a second-year higher education course on Financial Mathematics, consisted of 803 students, enrolled each Winter semester since 2014/2015. Traditional lectures were complemented by the application of pedagogical principles that support the inverted learning and online support through a SPOC.
   The effectiveness of the methodology used is revealed by the results obtained.

AB In recent years, learning process data have become increasingly easy to collect through computer-based learning environments. This has led to increased interest in the field of learning analytics, which is concerned with leveraging learning process data in order to better understand, and ultimately to improve, teaching and learning. In computing education, the logical place to collect learning process data is through integrated development environments (IDEs), where computing students typically spend large amounts of time working on programming assignments. While the primary purpose of IDEs is to support computer programming, they might also be used as a mechanism for delivering learning interventions designed to enhance student learning. The possibility of using IDEs both to collect learning process data, and to strategically intervene in the learning process, suggests an exciting design space for computing education research: that of IDE-based learning analytics. In order to facilitate the systematic exploration of this design space, we present an IDE-based data analytics process model with four primary activities: (1) Collect data, (2) Analyze data, (3) Design intervention, and (4) Deliver intervention. For each activity, we identify key design dimensions and review relevant computing education literature. To provide guidance on designing effective interventions, we describe four relevant learning theories, and consider their implications for design. Based on our review, we present a call-to-action for future research into IDE-based learning analytics.

AB The aim of this paper is to explore ambient learning and emergent learning in the context of emerging and next generation technologies such as wireless grids. Using WeJay, an early pre-standards social radio tool, research with faculty and students provides insight into the potential of wireless grids for learning in distributed technology-pervasive environments. Findings are interpreted in terms of their implications for educational, research, and practice settings. Expanded notions of workplace, educational spaces, and places of research are advanced together with the value and importance of leveraging associated learning and predictive analytics data. This paper contributes to research on: ambient and emergent learning, pervasive learning spaces (PLSs), ambient intelligence (AmI), and wireless grids. Responding to earlier calls for a new research agenda around learning in technologypervasive environments for the 21st century, this paper elucidates a new learning approach based on ambient intelligence (AmI) with wireless grids.

AB E-Learning is often associated with Learning analytics (LA) as a tool used to determine the actual extent to which the students use the content. Traditional LA is able to provide data on the number of visits and retrievals of a given website or parts thereof. When using common LA tools (e.g. web metrics systems), it is usually possible to reliably measure data relating to the entire website or its individual parts. The analysis of log files (e.g. from LMS systems), on the other hand, allows for the identification of visits and retrievals for individual logged-in users. Both of these approaches to LA can be described as quantitative. However, quantitative metrics are often too vague and general to offer a better insight into the approach, behaviour, and perception of educational content. Such metrics measure the content in terms of quantity and frequency, overlooking the details of the individual students' approach. Therefore, we focused on the possibility of a more detailed method to monitor the students' activities in the course. We used a record of individual student visits which included recording of mouse cursor movements, insertions of content in forms, visited web pages, scrolling on these pages, and visits of external hypertext links. We have thusly obtained a large amount of qualitative video data concerning the students' movement in two e-Learning courses (e-Learning and wiki course) taught at our workplace. We created the records for individual students, so it is possible to monitor their progress through the course on various devices. We used these records to perform an analysis of student behaviour (coding, summarisation), which is presented here on selected examples together with the conclusions. Such qualitative LA allows us to have a different look at the students' perception of the course content and to find possible issues and areas suitable for a subsequent quantitative analysis.

ID STRATEGY
AB A major promise of learning analytics is that through the collection of large amounts of data we can derive insights from authentic learning environments, and impact many learners at scale. However, the context in which the learning occurs is important for educational innovations to impact student learning. In particular, for student-facing learning analytics systems like feedback tools to work effectively, they have to be integrated with pedagogical approaches and the learning design. This paper proposes a conceptual model to strike a balance between the concepts of generalizable scalable support and contextualized specific support by clarifying key elements that help to contextualize student-facing learning analytics tools. We demonstrate an implementation of the model using a writing analytics example, where the features, feedback and learning activities around the automated writing feedback tool are tuned for the pedagogical context and the assessment regime in hand, by co-designing them with the subject experts. The model can be employed for learning analytics to move from generalized support to meaningful contextualized support for enhancing learning.

AB The master thesis is the last formal step in most universities around the world. However, all students do not finish their master thesis. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the non-completion of the master thesis should be viewed as a substantial problem that requires serious attention and proactive planning. This learning analytics study aims to understand better factors that influence completion and non-completion of master thesis projects. More specifically, we ask: which student and supervisor factors influence completion and non-completion of master thesis? Can we predict completion and non-completion of master thesis using such variables in order to optimise the matching of supervisors and students? To answer the research questions, we extracted data about supervisors and students from two thesis management systems which record large amounts of data related to the thesis process. The sample used was 755 master thesis projects supervised by 109 teachers. By applying traditional statistical methods (descriptive statistics, correlation tests and independent sample t-tests), as well as machine learning algorithms, we identify five central factors that can accurately predict master thesis completion and non-completion. Besides the identified predictors that explain master thesis completion and non-completion, this study contributes to demonstrating how educational data and learning analytics can produce actionable data-driven insights. In this case, insights that can be utilised to inform and optimise how supervisors and students are matched and to stimulate targeted training and capacity building of supervisors.

AB Current approaches to assessing digital competence in education may be too broad to support teachers in developing their online learning designs in specific subjects. During the pandemic, studies have identified that the development of teaching practices (and subsequently their learning designs) has taken a leap. However, because digital cultures differ between schools, local approaches need to survey how their practices have developed and what emerging practices can become good examples for others. Using a descriptive multiple case (n = 20) study methodology with observations, interviews (n = 33), and a survey, 12 elements in second language online learning designs (LDs) that seemed to engage learners and support online learning were identified. Data were analysed using pattern matching and descriptive statistics. Post observation, teachers were asked to rate the importance of the ability to include the element and how difficult they perceived its implementation would be. A case overview was used to contrast the survey. Results reveal that the number of digital technologies has little to do with the complexity of designs, and teachers with relatively few digital resources can offer more complex LDs. While most teachers rated the elements suggested as easy, the observations did not support this. However, around 30% of the teachers rated at least seven important elements as difficult or very difficult and designing learning activities that stimulate engagement in nuanced ways was considered challenging. This paper proposes that, identifying local elements may be a suitable way forward to support professional development, as well as to reframe teachers' digital practices post Covid-19.

AB Serious Games have already proved their advantages in different educational environments. Combining them with Game Learning Analytics can further improve the life-cycle of serious games, by informing decisions that shorten development time and reduce development iterations while improving their impact, therefore fostering their adoption. Game Learning Analytics is an evidence-based methodology based on in-game user interaction data, and can provide insight about the game-based educational experience promoting aspects such as a better assessment of the learning process. In this article, we review our experiences and results applying Game Learning Analytics for serious games in three different scenarios: (1) validating and deploying a game to raise awareness about cyberbullying, (2) validating the design of a game to improve independent living of users with intellectual disabilities and (3) improving the evaluation of a game on first aid techniques. These experiences show different uses of game learning analytics in the context of serious games to improve their design, evaluation and deployment processes. Building up from these experiences, we discuss the results obtained and provide lessons learnt from these different applications, to provide an approach that can be generalized to improve the design and application of a wide range of serious games in different educational settings.

DE Seamless learning; formal/informal learning analytics
AB Learning takes place in a variety of different environments, both in-class as of formal learning and outside as informal learning. Seamless learning offers the opportunity to learn in different environments regardless of location or time. Students can benefit from learning in many contexts, and it can also provide insights for teachers into how learning is being conducted in informal situations outside the classroom. Previous work into the analysis of seamless learning has mainly focused on purpose build specialized systems that provide an environment for a specific task. In recent years, the field of learning analytics has been growing and learning environments are increasingly being developed across different modular systems that are linked together by standards-based protocols. In order to analyze seamless learning on a larger scale, this paper proposes the integration of an informal learning system, SCROLL, into a wider modular system. The proposed system addresses fundamental problems, such as the protection of user privacy and authentication while increasing the availability of data for analysis from other learning systems. We also examine the ability to analyze and visualize learning across numerous environments and contexts.

AB The article presents results of a survey and interviews mapping students' expectations and needs on learning analytics. The discussion focuses on the functionalities and features which were considered to support selfregulated learning in Moodle learning environment. The aim of the discussion is to identify how the reported student needs could be met by utilizing descriptive, prescriptive or predictive learning analytics.
   It was discovered that students need and expect certain functions in the digital learning environment to support self-regulated learning. The survey results indicate that students mainly demand for tools which could help them in planning and scheduling their studies. Secondly, to be able to monitor and regulate their performance, they need progression tracking tools as well as timely and constructive feedback. Features of descriptive analytics were considered the most useful for self-regulation, while the expected benefits of prescriptive and predictive analytics were more controversial and tentative.

AB The educational community continuously seeks ways to improve the learner-centered learning process through new approaches like Learning analytics and its dashboard, which is helpful to enhance the teaching and the learning process. It involves a process whose final goal is presenting results to support decision-making about improving the learning process. However, a descriptive Learning analytics interface for analyzing learning data of students, including the disadvantaged, where to view and interpret learners' historical data is -in general- missing in this research domain. Hence, more research is still required to establish the philosophy of learning analytics on inclusion with an interface for the stakeholders to understand learning and teaching in an inclusive learning environment. This paper fills this gap by providing an inclusive educational learning analytics dashboard to support teachers and students. This study aimed to present a learning analytics implementation in the context of a smart ecosystem for learning and inclusion. We gave the inclusive educational needs and discussed the workflow followed during the descriptive learning analytics dashboard development. Therefore, the study improved existing learning analytics dashboards with a descriptive approach and inclusiveness of students with disabilities. Owing to the software development nature of this study, agile methodology based on five stages was applied: requirement elicitation; data gathering; design and prototyping; implementation; and testing and integration. We performed an initial evaluation, which indicated that the dashboard is suitable for understanding teachers' and students' needs and expectations. Besides, the visualization of inclusive learning characteristics improves engagement and attainment of learning goals.

AB Learning Analytics and Gamification are examples of some strategies that have been applied in educational context as an attempt to reduce motivational problems. While learning analytics seek to analyze learners and their contexts in order to understand and improve the teaching-learning process, gamification applies all suitable game elements in learning environments to motivate and engage students. This work aims to integrate learning analytics techniques and game elements in a virtual learning environment and verify if this integration increased students' interaction and satisfaction. Through a controlled experiment, 77 undergraduate students were divided into two groups (i.e., experimental and control) and their participation in an online course was monitored. As a result, the satisfaction was higher for the experimental group, although there was no significant difference between the groups in relation to their interaction.

AB Purpose The analysis of data collected from user interactions with educational and information technology has attracted much attention as a promising approach to advancing our understanding of the learning process. This promise motivated the emergence of the field of learning analytics and supported the education sector in moving toward data-informed strategic decision making. Yet, progress to date in embedding such data-informed processes has been limited. The purpose of this paper is to address a commonly posed question asked by educators, managers, administrators and researchers seeking to implement learning analytics - how do we start institutional adoption of learning analytics? Design/methodology/approach A narrative review is performed to synthesize the existing literature on learning analytics adoption in higher education. The synthesis is based on the established models for the adoption of business analytics and finding two projects performed in Australia and Europe to develop and evaluate approaches to adoption of learning analytics in higher education. Findings The paper first defines learning analytics and touches on lessons learned from some well-known case studies. The paper then reviews the current state of institutional adoption of learning analytics by examining evidence produced in several studies conducted worldwide. The paper next outlines an approach to learning analytics adoption that could aid system-wide institutional transformation. The approach also highlights critical challenges that require close attention in order for learning analytics to make a long-term impact on research and practice of learning and teaching. Originality/value The paper proposed approach that can be used by senior leaders, practitioners and researchers interested in adoption of learning analytics in higher education. The proposed approach highlights the importance of the socio-technical nature of learning analytics and complexities pertinent to innovation adoption in higher education institutions.

AB BackgroundAugmented reality has been widely applied in various fields, and its benefits in language learning have been increasingly recognized. However, the investigation of effective learning behaviours and processes in augmented reality learning environments, taking into account temporality and analysis of differences in learning behaviours between learning achievements from the perspective of learning strategies, is still a topic that requires further research. ObjectivesThe goal of this research is to explore effective learning processes in AR language learning environments and learning behavioural patterns of learners with different performance levels via LA taking into account temporality. MethodsWe used the learning application designed and developed in previous studies to understand the learning process and behavioural patterns of acquiring Japanese compound verbs with augmented reality. Lag sequential analyses were conducted to analyse the learning behavioural transitions using learning data. Additionally, frequent sequences were analysed using frequent sequence mining to compare the learning behavioural patterns of learners with different learning performances. Results and ConclusionsWe investigated the learning process and behavioural patterns and discussed the language learning strategies employed in the augmented reality learning environment. The results indicated that learners primarily performed strategies of performed expressions, recombining, and structured reviewing in AR compound verb learning activities. Furthermore, the results revealed the different types of strategies applied by different learning performance learners, whereby the low group learners used the least variety of strategies, and the middle and high group learners employed repeating and deductive reasoning strategies that were not followed by the low group.

AB Advances in mobile technology are providing new opportunities for mobile learning. Augmented reality (AR) technologies may be used on mobile devices and have the potential to facilitate improvements in learning performance. Meanwhile, the amount of data available about learners and their learning activities is rapidly increasing. Using learning analytics allows the collection of learning data to effectively analyze learning behaviors and processes. In this study, we designed and developed an AR learning system based on the temporal and spatial continuity principles of the multimedia learning theory to aid Japanese compound verb acquisition. We also employed the learner-to-learning materials interaction to analyze the relationship between learning behaviors and learning performance. The results showed that the use of an AR learning system assisted learners in improving their learning and retention of compound verbs, whereas repeated trials of the learning behavior enhanced the learning of compound verbs.

AB Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are allowing education to become accessible to all learners. HoNs ever, computers are currently not able to provide the same individual expertise and support as a human instructor, making it difficult to tailor the course for each student. This work proposes using machine learning analytics to provide useful individualized feedback to learners in a Cardiovascular Engineering Innovation-Based Learning course. The system will monitor students' habits as they form learning objectives and progress through the course, allowing the system to learn to make recommendations for the student. The architecture of the developed system is presented, a test set is used to verify, and the context of future pilot tests is introduced. Although this work is presently specific to one particular course, it can be adapted to allow for personalization of any MOOC that allows for differentiated, higher level learning.

In this study, we designed an e-learning blended classroom lecture for the first-year students, and most of the learning activities could be recorded in the e-learning system. We also developed a visualization dashboard using the log data of the e-learning system. Teachers could visualize students' learning activities dynamically, and interactively on their own analytic views to analyze students' learning activities and to design efficient teaching strategies.

AB Word learning remains a complicated process for humans even though technology-enhanced learning platforms such as u-learning, m-learning, computer-assisted language learning have shown great promise. Limited learning scopes and lack of motivation remained the criticisms and challenges for ubiquitous and mobile learning research. This study aims to integrate three computer-assisted language learning tools, namely AIVAS (Appropriate Image-based Image Acquisition System), IU (Image Understanding) Ecosystem, and IVLS (Incidental Vocabulary Learning System), to broaden the word learning scopes. With this integration, the users of these systems would learn incidental and intentional vocabulary seamlessly. Furthermore, this paper addresses issues on image analytics to design new methodologies to broaden the word learning scopes in informal learning.

AB Mobile technologies and their applications have the potential to benefit various learning contexts. Users' perceptions of mobile learning (m-learning) technologies are of great importance and precede the successful integration of these technologies in education. M-learning adoption has been investigated in the literature with reference to various factors and learning analytics, but largely without considering the role of different configurations (i.e., specific combinations of variables), and how these configurations might affect the adoption of various user groups. For instance, users with different backgrounds, experiences, learning styles, and so on might not be represented by the one-model-fits-all produced from the common regression approaches. In this study, we briefly review factors that have been proven important in the context of mobile learning adoption, and build on complexity theory and configuration theory in order to explore the causal patterns of factors that stimulate the use of mobile learning. To test its propositions, the study employs fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on a data sample from 180 experienced m-learning users. Findings indicate eight configurations of cognitive and affective characteristics, and social and individual factors, that explain m-learning adoption. This research study contributes to the literature by (1) offering new insights on how predictors of m-learning adoption interrelate: (2) extending existing knowledge on how cognitive and affective characteristics, and social and individual factors, combine to lead to high m-learning adoption: and (3) presenting a step-by-step methodological approach for how to apply fsQCA in the area of learning systems and learning analytics.

AB Teaching has moved online as the world has moved online and learning is losing its sense of physical location with the availability of many different options from mobile to MOOC (Massive Open Online Course). The impact of online learning is not confined to distance learning; when a student attends a campus university they are now as likely to meet with their fellow learners virtually as face to face. The education sector has yet to fully adapt to what this means, and indeed there strong signs of a built in resilience from providers, employers and students themselves which may mean an apparent evolution is more likely than a revolution. At the same time, there are some quiet changes underway that mean we should be preparing to innovate for the revolution to come. Some of those changes are considered in work undertaken at The Open University that has been disseminated in a series of Innovating Pedagogy reports. These reports allow the academic authors to be more speculative than is usual practice and engage in considering the future, while remaining based on a view of what is happening in the sector. In particular they adopt a position focused on pedagogy that balances technology-based futurology that can dominate yet fail to resonate with those actually involved in the teaching process. The annual Innovating Pedagogy reports cover 10 topics each, with some deliberate overlap from year to year and development of themes that show innovations moving into teaching practice. This is illustrated by two cases, the impact of MOOCs and the application of learning design and analytics. The development of MOOCs demonstrates the value of reviewing pedagogy that aligns with technology. While the use of learning design and learning analytics demonstrates how improvements in the way we describe our learning processes and the way we understand learner behaviour is helping determine how choices in pedagogy impact on student satisfaction, progression and success.

AB With the increase in available educational data, it is expected that Learning Analytics will become a powerful means to inform and support learners, teachers and their institutions in better understanding and predicting personal learning needs and performance. However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency.
   Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.

AB This study examines six years of Google Analytics collected from a graduate-level, open-access online course with the purpose of understanding the characteristics of the online learners and their learning behaviors. By reporting key statistics regarding online students' demography, behavior and technology use, this study reveals an overall online learning pattern for the context of open higher education, and identifies several trending changes in students' online learning profiles and behaviors. In addition, this study demonstrates the useful features of Google Analytics and provides insights on how to use them for collecting, analyzing and displaying learning analytics. The study results are expected to enhance our understanding of online learning at a course level and inform the design and development of online courses and resources for higher education contexts.

AB Promoted by the growing access to mobile devices and the emphasis on situated learning, location-based tools are being used increasingly in education. Multiple stakeholders could benefit from understanding the learning and teaching processes triggered by these tools, supported by data analytics. For instance, practitioners could use analytics to monitor and regulate the implementation of their learning designs (LD), as well as to assess their impact and effectiveness. Also, the community around specific tools-such as researchers, managers of educational institutions, and developers-could use analytics to further improve the tools and better understand their adoption. This paper reports the co-design process of a location-based authoring tool that incorporates multi-stakeholder analytics for LD features. It contributes to the research community through a case study that investigates how analytics can support specific LD needs of different stakeholders of location-based tools. Results emphasise opportunities and implications of aligning analytics and LD in location-based learning.

AB The application of learning analytics in an online learning environment is increasing among researchers in educational fields because it can assist in providing standard and measurable decision making about student success. In this regard, there is a need for the online learning society and practitioners to be informed about how learning analytics is applied in the online learning environment. Therefore, this systematic review article aims to offer the reader essential details regarding the practical usage of learning analytics techniques in online learning environments to improve the quality of teaching and learning practices. The focal point of this review is threefold: to ascertain the focus of learning analytics research in online learning environments and its significant results, to identify the types of student-related analytics data in online learning environments and the issues related to analytics data, and to inform about the extent of interventions that have been applied in the learning analytics context, if any. Four procedures suggested by PRISMA were applied when conducting a systematic review. A total of 34 articles were chosen according to the review selection guideline by searching through online databases, including ACM Digital Library, LearnTechLib, ERIC, International Forum of Educational Technology & Society, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, Society for Learning Analytics Research, and SpringerLink. The search keywords used were learning analytics data and online learning, learning analytics data and learning analytics intervention. The results were analysed based on the three focuses mentioned earlier and were interpreted accordingly. It is found that the applied focus of learning analytics is more oriented towards monitoring/analysis and prediction/intervention, and the commonly used types of student-analytics data are learning behaviour data and learning level data. Additionally, the intervention is still in the process of being developed. Lastly, the directions for future studies and limitations are also provided so as to further develop this emerging research area, and the findings can be a good reference point for other researchers.

AB Many studies have highlighted the importance of personalized learning, and most current e-learning systems are able to personalize materials, activities, etc., based on individualized learner-factors. However, none of the extant word-learning systems provides a personalized learning experience that is guided by a comprehensive word learning theory. In this study, we develop such a system based on Nation and Webb's checklist for technique feature analysis - a thorough set of factors that promote effective word learning. This system recommends personalized word learning tasks based on the technique feature analysis scores of different tasks and user models. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed system, we conducted an experiment among 105 English learners, grouped them into three teams randomly, and asked them to learn forty target words through three approaches: a non-personalized approach, a personalized approach guided by a partial version of the technique feature analysis, and a personalized approach guided by the full list of the technique feature analysis. Significant differences were observed among the effectiveness of the three approaches in promoting word learning, with the personalized approach guided by the complete checklist leading to the best learning performance. It is therefore suggested that e-learning systems should be designed based on comprehensive learning theories.

AB Gamification is one of the most used techniques to improve active participation and engagement in different kinds of contexts. The use of game techniques is effective in pushing subjects to be involved in an activity. Since the early childhood, indeed, the promises of rewards are useful to affect specific behaviors. On the other hands, the learning analytics have been largely implemented in education in order to improve the assessment and the self-assessment of students, above all in e-learning settings. The research presented in this work aims at combining gamification techniques and learning analytics to improve the engagement in University courses. The paper describes a model of gamification and a learning dashboard defined based on data in Moodle e-learning platform. A pilot test of an app android in which both the solutions have been implemented pointed out promising results.

AB Predictive analytics in higher education has become increasingly popular in recent years with the growing availability of educational big data. Particularly, a wealth of student activity data is available from learning management systems (LMSs) in most academic institutions. However, previous investigations into predictive analytics in higher education using LMS activity data did not adequatelyaccommodate student behaviours in the form of time series. In this study, we have applied a deep learning approach - long short-term memory (LSTM) networks - to analyze student online temporal behaviours using their LMS data for the early prediction of course performance. To reveal the potential of the deep learning approach in predictive analytics, we compared LSTM networks with eight conventional machine-learning classifiers in terms of the prediction performance as measured by the area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC) scores. Results indicate that using the deep learning approach, time series information about click frequencies successfully provided early detection of at-risk students with moderate prediction accuracy. In addition, the deep learning approach showed higher prediction performance and stronger generalizability than the machine learning classifiers.

AB The widespread success of Massive Open Online Courses in higher education requires even further development of learning analytics customized to this framework. One of the features of the learning analytics is the integration and combination of techniques to trace user behavior in order to create a `customized' learning. The aim of this paper is to propose multivariate data analysis methods to define the users' and the learning profile. The analysis refers to the courses offered by the Platform Federica.eu at University of Naples, Federico II.

   Learning and comprehension; Learning awareness
AB Metacognition plays an important role in the learning process as it allows learners to become better aware of their level of understanding and comprehension. Knowledge of learners' metacognition level allows teachers to provide feedback to learners to enable correction of learning strategies. However, measuring metacognition based upon learner activities outside a computer-based learning environment is a challenging task. This paper explores this challenge in adult learners for the purpose of developing a learning analytics model that can be used to influence the use of metacognitive strategies to improve learning and comprehension. As a solution, a novel learning analytics model is presented. This model is based upon data captured from a traditional physical classroom environment and can be used to build a working learning analytics model designed to provide feedback to the learner. Such feedback can provide insights of learners' use of metacognitive strategies with a view to improving their comprehension of a given topic and thus to improve their understanding of that topic and ultimately to improve their academic success.

AB Effective analysis and demonstration of these data features is of great significance for the optimization of interactive learning environment and learning behavior. Therefore, we take the big data set of learning behavior generated by an online interactive learning environment as the research object, define the features of learning behavior, and demonstrate their relationships. A key feature selection method for sparse learning based on data set is designed. The models and algorithms are fully trained and tested through a large number of experiments. Several approximate optimal algorithms are selected to compare the performance indicators. On this basis, the rule and relationships are mined and predicted for the key features, and the measures to improve the key features are proposed. The conclusion is that the guidance and construction of learning behavior based on the key features can have a significance on the learning effect, that has also been proved in practice. Driven by the actual data, it is an inevitable trend to design the suitable methods applied to key features of education big data. This research method and practice process can provide technical reference and theoretical basis for the similar topics.

AB Learning Analytics (LA) approaches have proved to be able to enhance learning process and learning performance. However, little is known about applying these approaches for second language acquisition using educational games. Therefore, this study applied LA approaches to design a smart collaborative educational game, to enhance primary school children learning English vocabularies. Specifically, the game provided dashboards to the teachers about their students in a real-time manner. A pilot experiment was conducted in a public primary school where the students' data from experimental and control groups, namely learning and motivation test scores, interview and observation, were collected and analyzed. The obtained results showed that the experimental group (who used the smart game with LA) had significantly higher motivation and performance for learning English vocabularies than the control group (who used the smart game without LA). The findings of this study can help researchers and practitioners incorporate LA in their educational games to help students enhance language acquisition.

AB We design a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based pencil drawing learning system for art education on large image datasets to help students study how to draw pencil drawings for images and scenes. The system generates a pencil drawing result for a natural image based on GAN. The GAN network is trained on pencil drawing big datasets containing image pairs of natural images and their corresponding pencil drawings. Using the pencil drawing learning system, students can paint pencil drawings whenever they want and for whatever they like by uploading an image of the content they want to draw and getting a pencil drawing example of the uploaded image from the system. With the returned pencil drawing, students will see the pencil drawing effect of natural scenes clearly and realize how to draw the pencil drawing for the natural scene. Besides, with students using the pencil drawing learning system, it will be convenient for teachers assigning homework to students. Teachers can know the learning demands of students by evaluating the hand-in homework and update the content correspondingly. We have conducted two user studies for evaluating the practicality of the system, and the result of the two user studies demonstrated the applicability and practicality of the system.

AB One of the difficulties experienced by online learners is the lack of regular supervision as well as the need to provide instructions to support the learning process more effectively. The analysis of the learning data in the online courses is not only becoming increasingly important in forecasting learning outcomes but also providing effective instructional strategies for learners to help them get the best results. In this paper, we propose a forecast learning outcomes model based on learners' interaction with online learning systems by providing learning analytics dashboard for both learners and teachers to monitor and orient online learners. This approach is mainly based on some machine learning and data mining techniques. This research aims to answer two research questions: (1) Is it possible to accurately predict learners' learning outcomes based on their interactive activities? (2) How to monitor and guide learners in an effective online learning environment? To answer these two questions, our model has been developed and tested by learners participating in the Moodle LMS system. The results show that 75% of students have outcomes close to the predicted results with an accuracy of over 50%. These positive results, though done on a small scale, can also be considered as suggestions for studies of using learning analytics in predicting learning outcomes of learners through learning activities.

AB The aim of the paper is to present methodology to personalise learning using learning analytics and to make further decisions on suitability, acceptance and use of personalised learning units. In the paper, first of all, related research review is presented. Further, an original methodology to personalise learning applying learning analytics in virtual learning environments and empirical research results are presented. Using this learning personalisation methodology, decision-making model and method are proposed to evaluate suitability, acceptance and use of personalised learning units. Personalised learning units evaluation methodology presented in the paper is based on (1) well-known principles of Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis for identifying evaluation criteria; (2) Educational Technology Acceptance & Satisfaction Model (ETAS-M) based on well-known Unified Theory on Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, and (3) probabilistic suitability indexes to identify learning components' suitability to particular students' needs according to their learning styles. In the paper, there are also examples of implementing the methodology using different weights of evaluation criteria. This methodology is applicable in real life situations where teachers have to help students to create and apply learning units that are most suitable for their needs and thus to improve education quality and efficiency.

AB Online education is growing but facing a problem of high academic failure rates. In self-paced online learning (SPOL), the lack of academic support - social interaction, formative feedback, learning awareness, and academic intervention - is recognized as a critical factor causing the academic failure problem. To facilitate such academic support, this study has identified three relevant technical and pedagogical strategies (formative assessment, adaptive assessment and learning analytics) that could work together as a possible solution. Design-based research is considered for this study to investigate the effectiveness of this solution in the context of STEM disciplines of formal higher online education. A computing course is selected for a case study. The design principles of the adaptive assessment model and the intervention learning analytics model are explained. Also, the expected contributions are summarized at the end.

AB Precision education requires two equally important conditions: accurate predictions of academic performance based on early observations of the learning process and the availability of relevant educational intervention options. The field of learning analytics (LA) has made important contributions to the realisation of the first condition, especially in the context of blended learning and online learning. Prediction models that use data from institutional information systems and logs of learning management systems have gained a good reputation in predicting underperformance and dropout risk. However, less progress is made in resolving the second condition: applying LA generated feedback to design educational interventions. In our contribution, we make a plea for applying dispositional learning analytics (DLA) to make LA precise and actionable. DLA combines learning data, as in LA, with learners' disposition data measured through self-report surveys. The advantage of DLA is twofold: first, it improves the accuracy of prediction, specifically early in the module, when limited LMS trace data are available. Second, the main benefit of DLA is in the design of effective interventions: interventions that focus on addressing individual learning dispositions that are less developed but important for being successful in the module. We provide an empirical analysis of DLA in an introductory mathematics module, demonstrating the important role that a broad range of learning dispositions can play in realising precision education.

AB This paper presents a learning analytics framework for 3D educational virtual worlds that focus on discovering learning flows and checking its conformance through process mining techniques. The core of this framework is an Opensim-based virtual world platform, known as OPENET4VE, that is compliant with the IMS Learning Design specification and that has the ability of monitoring and registering the events generated by students and teachers. Based on these event logs, process mining algorithms automatically extract the real learning flow of the course, allowing teachers to introduce changes in the learning flow initially proposed.

AB IMPACT How to effectively develop a framework of learning and development is a central challenge for contemporary organizations. New technologies and educational partnerships have transformed the ways in which professionals learn. This article explains how learning analytics can be used to design blended learning programmes and support learners in an evidence-informed way, so that learning 'failures' (withdrawal, underperformance and complaints) can be avoided. The article draws on several case studies, including the current learning and development challenges faced by police organizations in England and Wales, that support the case for learning analytics to achieve success in workforce training.

AB With the development of data mining and machine learning techniques, data-driven based technology-enhanced learning (TEL) has drawn wider attention. Researchers aim to use established or novel computational methods to solve educational problems in the 'big data' era. However, the readiness of data appears to be the bottleneck of the TEL development and very little research focuses on investigating the data scarcity and inappropriateness in the TEL research. This paper is investigating an emerging research topic in the TEL domain, namely micro learning. Micro learning consists of various technical themes that have been widely studied in the TEL research field. In this paper, we firstly propose a micro learning system, which includes recommendation, segmentation, annotation, and several learning-related prediction and analysis modules. For each module of the system, this paper reviews representative literature and discusses the data sources used in these studies to pinpoint their current problems and shortcomings, which might be debacles for more effective research outcomes. Accordingly, the data requirements and challenges for learning analytics in micro learning are also investigated. From a research contribution perspective, this paper serves as a basis to depict and understand the current status of the readiness of data sources for the research of micro learning.

AB Forming learners' science concepts and conceptual change entails adaptive epistemic beliefs to support a high degree of interactivity within a coherent knowledge structure. Adaptive epistemic beliefs are characterized by beliefs that knowledge is uncertain and should be justified through experimentation or multiple sources dependent upon the task contexts. Thus, assessing and evaluating learners' adaptive epistemic beliefs is a complex process that requires laborious analysis of learner artifacts based on reliable and valid coding schemes. This article aims to describe new ways of assessing and applying technologies that can measure and foster adaptive epistemic beliefs. We propose new strategies for a theoretically-based human-and-machine symbiotic Learning Analytics (LA) framework. The application of this LA framework may facilitate the development of real-time detecting and representation of the individual and collective epistemic belief networks as well as diagnosing and providing appropriate scaffolds to promote adaptive epistemic beliefs via the design of personalised pedagogical feedback with experts' input. The heuristic application of technology infrastructure may propel a movement for more tangible and personalised learning in science education. The current gaps of using AI-based emerging technologies in science learning and implications for science education are discussed to advance science education in new directions.

AB The paper is on a two-year study on the impact of technology-rich authentic learning environments (TALE) on the effectiveness of using mobile apps for teaching and learning in Singapore. The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of how teachers harness the use of technology-rich learning environments around them to help their students create, build and transfer knowledge in and across different sites of learning such as the classrooms and outside classrooms, and the simulated and non-simulated environments (e.g. students' work attachments, competitions or carnivals).
   Conventionally and traditionally, knowledge was the mandate of learning institutions as they were designed for research and curation of knowledge. To share the knowledge efficiently, the field of pedagogy explores the most efficient way to gather big groups of learners and systematically, and hopefully effectively, transfer the knowledge to them. With affordances of technology, and disruptive technology, it opens up a plethora of seamless learning environment that can effectively engage the learners because whatever they are learning is real and relevant. This is the natural learning approach: micro- learning that seamlessly permeates between the classrooms and beyond where learning occurs through social settings and authentic learning environments like even a shopping mall or at the airport.
   The mobile application uses the ideas of gamification and game mechanics, which are often found in digital electronic games (e.g. computer and video games) such as:
   (1) rewarding students with points to motivate them to engage with their classroom academic learning;
   (2) deciphering closely the backend analytics of the application;
   (3) examining how learning and literacies are acquired across different environments;
   (4) making interpretations of the transfer of learning; and
   (5) integrating the learning opportunities that arise from learning transfer to the instructional and/or vocational education curriculum. Motivation and self- efficacy are measured too.

ID DISCOVERY
AB With the increasing use of blended learning approaches in classroom, various kinds of technologies are incorporated to provide digital teaching and learning resources to support students. These resources are often centralized in learning management systems (LMSs), which also store valuable learning data of students. The data could assist teachers in their pedagogical decision making but they are often not well utilized. This paper proposes the use of data mining and visualization techniques as learning analytics to provide a more comprehensive overview of students' learning online based on log data from LMSs. The focus of this study is the discovery of frequent navigational patterns by sequential pattern mining techniques and the demonstration of how presentation of patterns through hierarchical clustering and sunburst visualization could facilitate the interpretation of patterns. The data in this paper were collected from a blended statistics course for undergraduate students.

AB Learning Analytics provides methods for measuring, collecting and analyzing data about learners and their contexts, for the purpose of understanding and optimizing the learning process and its environments. In recent years, most research has been conducted regarding methodologies or technological challenges of Learning Analytics. Little research has been done regarding software engineering and the software implementation of Learning Analytics for the use in Learning Management Systems. This makes it currently difficult or even impossible for researchers and teachers to use current research results without writing software on their own.
   In this paper, we first present existing Learning Analytics tools for the Learning Management System Moodle. We discuss different implemented methodologies and how each software integrates into the learning platform. After that, we present the possible approaches to develop Learning Analytics software for Moodle. Based on the presented software, we explain the advantages and disadvantages of the different development approaches. While some approaches allow a deep integration into the Learning Management System but are focused on only the Moodle system, other approaches can track the user over various different systems.
   Lastly, we describe our own Learning Analytics software implementation for Moodle. It is developed as plugin for the platform allowing it to be easily installable and well integrated into Moodle from a user perspective. Furthermore, its functionality can be extended by installing additional plugins. This makes it possible to extend the functionality by writing minimal and focused plugins. In the paper, we explain how the software is integrated into Moodle as well as how plugins can be developed to extend its functionality. We discuss our software design decisions and explain their benefits.

DE Learning Analytics; Visualisation; Corporate Learning; LMS
AB Popular learning management systems (LMS) often feature dashboards displaying various analytics. This dashboard display might be suboptimal for some learning and development managers (L&D). Moreover, the analytics presented are often based on standardised quizzes or semesters, which might be unsuitable (e. g., informal learning, corporate education, etc.). Finally, each LMS has its bespoke reporting solution, thus making it difficult for L&D managers to monitor the situation across various LMSs. We propose an interactive system where an L&D manager can customise the data source, queries, filters, and visualisations of their LMSs, and display them inline. To this end, we have built EVADE, a system that allows L&D managers to capture data from various LMSs, analyse them, and embed related visualisations in each LMS. In this instance, we have integrated EVADE with a Moodle instance for corporate education, and Almanac, a tablet application for informal learning. In this paper we present EVADE and discuss how it can improve the L&D manager-LMS interaction.

AB The integration of blended learning in teaching English at The National School of Engineers of Tunis (ENIT), Tunisia through the introduction of a multimedia courseware (DynEd) in the curriculum, is hoped to improve the proficiency level of future engineers. This paper is a report on a case study focusing on the experience of implementing DynEd within the scope of the Support Programme for Quality (QIP) in education. The study focuses on ENIT PhD students taking DynEd courseware along with a blended learning situation. Empirical data consist in pre-test and post-test data from DynEd records manager. Moreover, a questionnaire is administered to tease out the students' perceptions of a blended learning course, the teachers' role and the synchronization of face-to-face class with DynEd courseware. The results will be used to illustrate aspects of the blended program outcomes and student's perceptions of the teaching methodology embedded in DynEd, the technological tools and the impact of the blended learning environment on their level. This study adopted statistical and quantitative analytical procedures for analysis. The results taken from DynEd record logs indicate that students' proficiency levels in English improved. This is supplemented by the personal reports which indicate that the students felt that they have improved at the level of fluency and accuracy. The paper ends with the study results and recommendations for further research and for teaching in a blended learning context.

AB In a time when blended learning is the norm and not the exception, ePortfolio implementation has the potential to serve as a tool for 21st-century skills development, namely self-reflection, self-assessment, goal-setting, evi-dence-based learning, as well as a tool for digital literacy development. Two learning scenarios implementing ePortfolio in teaching and learning processes are presented. The first one deals with a learning model, following principles of autonomous learning applied in language learning, with a focus on goal-setting and evidence-based portfolio as a growth portfolio, with attention to applied assessment types and learning processes of university students. A constructivist approach to ePortfolio creation makes a solid foundation for the learning model. The second scenario of ePortfolio implementation presents how to use ePortfolio in pre-service teacher education, especially as an active learning strategy in the subject oriented to technology-enhanced learning. Students present in ePortfolios interviews with different target groups, relevant materials research, best practices, and applications. ePortfolios are shared between students, and create a special dynamic effect in the online course. Both presented case studies highlight the differences in positivist and constructivist approaches to ePortfolio implementation with respect to student behavior in areas of their attitudes and learning processes and evidencing. In both scenarios, learning analytics are used as an important tool to monitor students' work and for the gradual improvement of ePortfolio implementation model. Presented results prove ePortfolio tool to be a high impact practice fostering student autonomy and active learning.

AB Higher education sector is always incorporating changes pertaining to the technology to provide better teaching and learning environment to the stakeholders, which includes students and faculty members. A smart classroom is the one, which is equipped with latest tools and technologies that are based on the internet. Various web-based tools are also being used to enhance teaching and learning experience. To provide appropriate content to the students, based on their level of understanding, learning analytics could be helpful. Students would be provided with the content, based on assessments and tests, the result of which could analyze the area of improvement suggested for them. In this way, faculty can ensure that learning is taking place at each level in the classroom. This research paper highlights such environment which provides a strong base for learning analytics for enhanced learning environment especially in higher education.

AB The nature of teaching and learning has evolved over the years, especially as technology has evolved. Innovative application of educational analytics has gained momentum. Indeed, predictive analytics have become increasingly salient in education. Considering the prevalence of learner-system interaction data and the potential value of such data, it is not surprising that significant scholarly attention has been directed at understanding ways of drawing insights from educational data. Although prior literature on educational big data recognizes the utility of deep learning and machine learning methods, little research examines both deep learning and machine learning together, and the differences in predictive performance have been relatively understudied. This paper aims to present a comprehensive comparison of predictive performance using deep learning and machine learning. Specifically, we use educational big data in the context of predicting dropout in MOOCs. We find that machine learning classifiers can predict equally well as deep learning classifiers. This research advances our understanding of the use of deep learning and machine learning in optimizing dropout prediction performance models.

AB The present article is aimed at analyzing the effects of learning analytics on students' self-regulated learning in a flipped classroom. An experiment was conducted with 96 engineering students, enrolled in a subject offered in the Flipped Classroom model. The students were divided into two groups: an experimental group (N = 51) and a control group (N = 45). After each learning unit, while the control group did not have access to any learning analytics resources, students from the experimental group received a bulletin with feedback to support Self-Regulated Learning. The levels of student self-regulation were measured through questionnaires at the beginning and the end of the course. The analysis of the collected data revealed that the bulletin promoted significant effects in self-regulated learning in the experimental group, stimulating the self-reflection and colleague's support search for clarifying doubts. These results demonstrate that learning analytics can be used to promote self-regulated learning in flipped classrooms, helping students identify strategies that can increase their academic performance.

AB Learning Analytics is a dynamic interdisciplinary field that encompasses educational sciences and state-of-the-art technology, methods and systems from various fields of computing such as data science, data visualization, software engineering, human-computer interaction, statistics, artificial intelligence, with various stakeholders, e.g. instructors, students, department and college administrators, practitioners, university top managers, computer scientists, IT experts, and software developers. Despite some current achievements and initial developments in Learning Analytics, we are still in a very early stage of development of sophisticated technologies and well-thought practices, tools and applications in this field as well as understanding the impact of Learning Analytics on (a) student learning and privacy, and (b) faculty instruction and autonomy. This paper presents the up-to-date research findings and outcomes of a multi-aspect project on Smart Learning Analytics at Bradley University (USA). It describes the obtained research outcomes about student perception and attitude to Learning Analytics on an academic course level and corresponding Learning Analytics-based pedagogy.

AB recently there have been some efforts, albeit limited, to identify the optimal use of the available arrays of data in higher education for many purposes, such as to identify those students who are at risk and to evaluate student dropout rates. In the literature, the two main terms for the efforts made to identify practical ways of making use of higher education data are Academic Analytics and Learning Analytics. For the most part, these efforts tend to focus more on the traditional or non-mobile students' data, which are pre-stored in many university systems, such as their personal details or tracking information taken from students' learning activities. However, little attention has been paid to the data of mobile learners. In this paper, the possible benefits of using Learning Analytics techniques to enhance mobile and pervasive learning environments are theoretically examined. Furthermore, we describe our early efforts towards realising the significance of Learning Analytics in the mobile learning environment.

AB In this paper, we present an in-depth case study of a single student who failed an online module which formed part of a master's programme in Professional Education and Leadership. We use this case study to examine assessment practices in higher education in the online environment. In taking this approach, we go against the current predilection for Big Data which has given rise to learning analytics', a data-intensive approach to monitoring learning. In particular, we draw attention to the model of the learner produced by learning analytics and to issues of dataveillance' in online learning. We also use the case to examine assessment in higher education more broadly, exploring the tensions between the requirements for certification and the need for learning. We conclude that assessment practices in higher education may have more to do with quality assurance' and regulatory frameworks than with enhancing the student experience' and inculcating the qualities that mark out higher education as an ethical project.

AB The aims of this longitudinal study were to describe undergraduates' learning behavioral types in e-learning and to investigate their relationship to learning outcomes over an entire semester. In the first part of the study, 441 students at a national university in Japan were analyzed with regard to their visualization of learning progress. Seven distinct types of learning behavior were identified: (1) procrastination, (2) learning habit, (3) random, (4) diminished drive, (5) early bird, (6) chevron, and (7) catch-up. In the second part of this study, data from 226 students were analyzed. The results showed significant relationships between their learning type and ultimate learning outcomes. The students who exhibited the learning habit type scored significantly higher on the test than those students of the procrastination type. The results imply that regulated learning (i.e., forming a learning habit) could increase learning effectiveness and lead to better learning outcomes in e-learning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB The arrival of big data and AI era promote educational reforms, which make personalized learning become normalization. Teaching intervention is an indispensable bridge between big data and students' personalized learning. This study proposes an intervention model based on learning analytics from four iteration modules: data collection, data processing, intervention implementation and effect evaluation, and applies it to blended learning environment. Through one-group pretest-posttest experiment design, the effect of the intervention model were measured by learning engagement and learning achievement. The results show that the intervention model can effectively improve students' behavioral engagement and cognitive engagement as well as learning achievement, especially for risky students.

AB During the COVID-19 pandemic period, all the Sri Lankan universities delivered lectures in fully online mode using Virtual Learning Environments. In fully online mode, students cannot track their performance level, their progress in the course, and their performances compared to the rest of the class. This paper presents research work conducted at the University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC), Sri Lanka, to solve the above problems and facilitate students learning in fully online and blended learning environments using Learning Analytics. The research objective is to design and create a Technology Enhanced Learning Analytics (TELA) dashboard for improving students' motivation, engagement, and grades. The Design Science research strategy was followed to achieve the objectives of the research. Initially, a literature survey was conducted analyzing features and limitations in current Learning Analytic dashboards. Then, current Learning Analytic plugins for Moodle were studied to identify their drawbacks. Two surveys with 136 undergraduate students and interviews with 12 lecturers were conducted to determine required features of the TELA system. The system was designed as a Moodle Plugin. Finally, an evaluation of the system was done with third-year undergraduate students of the UCSC. The results showed that the TELA dashboard can improve students' motivation, engagement, and grades. As a result of the system, students could track their current progress and performance compared to the peers, which helps to improve their motivation to engage more in the course. Also, the increased engagement in the course enhances the student's self-confidence since the student can see continuous improvement of his/her progress and performance which in turn improves the student's grades.

AB Software pockets an indispensable role in the modern living style to make their work easy. Software engineers are the people who develop the software to comply with the user needs and make them joyful. Software engineering education is the place where the software engineers mold up academically for the society's requirement. As a result, software engineering education grabs the essence in the computer education, albeit it fall shorts to cook up the genius to meet with the industries necessity. To overcome these issues, researchers suggested number of software engineering learning/teaching methods to egg on students to acquire their profundity knowledge in software engineering. Even though the suggestions do not utterly surmount this crucial issue since the suggested approaches did not attract the majority of the students and touch their learning style. Learning analytics plays a vital role to improve the students learning activities. Learning style and learning engagement are the key factors for the learning analytics. This paper focuses on learning style and learning engagement of the software engineering students. This work classifies the students in line with their learning style and identifies the needs of the software engineering students using learning engagement finally proposed the model to inspire the students to overcome such issues and motivate them in gathering software engineering knowledge.

AB Learning analytics is a form of data analysis that allows teachers, lecturers, educational experts, and administrators of online learnings to look for students' online traces and information associated with the learning processes. The fundamental goal of learning analytics in online classrooms and computer-supported instruction is to enhance the learning experience and the entire learning process. This review aims at reviewing some of the benefits available through using learning analytics in higher education institutions (HEI) for the students, teaching staff and the management. The search for relevant literature was conducted by searching online databases which include Web of Science, SCOPUS, Science Direct, IEEE, Emerald, Springer, ERIC and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The analysis of the literatures obtained from the online databases revealed that learning analytics provide series of benefits to students, teaching staffs and the management of higher education institutions. The benefits include prediction and identification of target courses, curriculum development and improvement, improved students' learning outcomes, improved instructors' performance and monitoring of students' dropout and retention. It is recommended that higher education institutions adopt the use of learning analytics in their online teaching and learning.

AB In order to enhance the experience of learning, many educators applied learning analytics in a classroom, the major principle of learning analytics is targeting at-risk student and given timely intervention according to the results of student behavior analysis. However, when researchers applied machine learning to train a risk identifying model, the reason which affected the performance of the model was overlooked. This study collected seven datasets within three universities located in Taiwan and Japan and listed performance metrics of risk identification model after fed data into eight classification methods. U1, U2, and U3 were used to denote the three universities, which have three, two, and two cases of datasets (learning logs), respectively. According to the results of this study, the factors influencing the predictive performance of classification methods are the number of significant features, the number of categories of significant features, and Spearman correlation coefficient values. In U1 dataset case 1.3 and U2 dataset case 2.2, the numbers of significant features, numbers of categories of significant features, and Spearman correlation coefficient values for significant features were all relatively high, which is the main reason why these datasets were able to perform classification with high predictive ability.

AB Data-driven learning in combination with emerging academic areas such as Learning Analytics (LA) has the potential to tailor students' education to their needs [1]. The aim of this article is to present a web-based training platform for primary school pupils who struggle with the acquisition of German orthography. Our objective is the improvement in their writing and spelling competences. The focus of this article is on the development of the platform and the details concerning the requirements and the design of the User Interface (UI). In combination with Learning Analytics, the platform is expected to provide deeper insight into the process of spelling acquisition. Furthermore, aspects of Learning Analytics will help to develop the platform, to improve the exercises and to provide better materials in the long run.

AB We propose a model, Learning Activity Index (LAI) to describe learners' learning activities comprising three components, i.e., speed, quality and quantity. We then concretize this model into online learning and propose the Online Learning Activity Index (OLAI). With the example of a web-based mathematics learning system, OLAI can be calculated by the summarization of standardized and dimensionless speed, quality and quantity. So OLAI is also a dimensionless value and can comprehensively describe the learner's online learning behavior. We use OLAIMAA (OLAI Mean of All Activities) to measure one learner's online learning activities during a certain period on average and OLAISAA (OLAI Sum of All Activities) to measure those from a summative perspective. Similarly, the performance of a group, such as a class or a school, can also be described by those indexes. Furthermore, we design the personalized instructional strategies adaptive to the learner's OLAI and the OLAI of the learning group. The instructional strategies include the feedback corresponding to numerical intervals of three components of OLAI, bonus based on longitudinal comparison with the learner's own activity profile, bonus based on locally horizontal comparison with learner's classmates or partners in the same online group, and bonus based on globally horizontal comparison with all learners in the same system. We suggest that OLAI should be taken into consideration for the design of online learning platforms or course management system, and be referred as a basic approach to individualized instruction by both teachers and parents.

   learner profiling
AB Over the last few years learning analytics has emerged as a significant area of investigation in relation to learner profiling, improving learning outcomes and identifying learners at risk of exclusion or failure. Given the emergence of big data from a business context much of the research on learning analytics to date has focused on quantitative studies and the potential of summative test data to predict learner behaviour in the future. Moreover, analytics has often been perceived as a tool for institutions, administrators or instructors to track learners rather than as a tool to empower learners or to inform sound pedagogy. This paper aims to critically examine the challenges and opportunities presented by learning analytics in the context of providing student feedback in online language learning where few studies have yet to emerge. The research arises from a two-year EU funded project called VITAL (Visualisation Tools and Analytics to Monitor Online Language Learning and Teaching) (2016-2017) and explores how analytics can be used to inform online formative feedback to undergraduates on a blended learning module on business communication (n=200) and taught postgraduate students on a fully online master's degree (n=20) at a university in the UK. Both modules had a duration of 12 weeks and were taught using the Blackboard course management system. In both cases learners engaged with a series of online discussion board tasks punctuated by instructor feedback. Extracting data from Blackboard via manual SQL queries provided data showing the sequence of learner engagement and the frequency of views for learning activities, remedial resources, and instructor feedback. In turn this enabled instructors to examine correlations in the data as a result of visualization on dashboards. Results suggest that analytics can be used in real-time to design and implement interventions in order to identify when unsuccessful students are not reading or engaging with instructor feedback. The implications of the study indicate that more research is required on analytics to examine how much time students spend on formative feedback and the implications for grade performance. The study is significant in that instructor feedback is frequently identified by students as an important aspect of their online learning process, but little research has been done to date to investigate to what extent and in what ways learners access feedback and spend sufficient time reading it.

DE Learning Analytics; Linked Data; MOOCs; OERs
AB In this paper we propose an overview of Learning Analytics approaches in the context of Open education in its most recent developments related to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Linked Data (LD), both strictly interconnected to the Open Educational Resources (0ERs) concept. The MOOCs have developed as a seamless integration of different solutions and services which have appeared on the Web in recent years to enable the opening of courses to hundreds or thousands of participants on the Internet. Actually MOOCs combine, amongst others, the networking potentials offered by the social Web (developed around the Web 2.0 portals), the ease of access to OERs, the informal learning opportunities which characterize the learners' autonomy in identifying their own patterns to knowledge, thus changing the way learning occurs. The huge amount of data produced during a MOOC suggests that Learning Analytics techniques could be extremely useful to support the learning and teaching processes during the course. The Linked Data can be exploited in the educational field. In fact, LD offers educational benefits for teaching and learning by providing integration mechanisms of heterogeneous resources from diverse repositories and sources and by supporting automatic search techniques that provide learners with educational resources semantically related to a specific knowledge field. As a consequence, the huge amount of datasets of LD can be exploited for educational purposes, thus becoming an alternative source of Open Educational resources. The recent evolution of LD and its datasets has had a remarkable influence on Learning Analytics as well, so that Learning Analytics is not limited to numeric data, but it has to take into account data and their semantic representation. The aim of this paper is therefore to highlight through the analysis of the recent literature - how Learning Analytics can enhance learning experiences in Open Education settings based on MOOCs and LD.

ID INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEMS
AB Learning Analytics (LA) sits at the confluence of many contributing disciplines, which brings the risk of hidden assumptions inherited from those fields. Here, we consider a hidden assumption derived from computer science, namely, that improving computational accuracy in classification is always a worthy goal. We demonstrate that this assumption is unlikely to hold in some important educational contexts, and argue that embracing computational "imperfection" can improve outcomes for those scenarios. Specifically, we show that learner-facing approaches aimed at "learning how to learn" require more holistic validation strategies. We consider what information must be provided in order to reasonably evaluate algorithmic tools in LA, to facilitate transparency and realistic performance comparisons.

AB Learning analytics focuses on collecting, cleaning, processing, visualization and analyzing teaching and learning related data or metrics from a variety of academic sources. Our vision for engineering of smart learning analytics - the next generation of systems and tools for learning analytics - is based on the concept that this technology should strongly support "smartness" levels of smart academic institutions such as adaptivity, sensing, inferring, anticipation, self-learning, and self-organization. This paper presents the up-to-date findings and outcomes of research, design and development project at the InterLabs Research Institute at Bradley University (Peoria, IL, U.S.A.) that is focused on conceptual modeling of smart learning analytics systems, including identification of goals, objectives, features and functions, main components, inputs and outputs, hierarchical and smartness levels, mathematical methods and algorithms for those systems. Agile software engineering approach has been used for a development of a series of software prototypes to verify the design and development process and validate the obtained outcomes for smart learning analytics systems.

AB In this work we present a formal description of a learning environment framework that gives support to learning analytics. The framework is based on techniques that educational data mining and social network analysis provide. The purpose is to study or discover collaborative relationships that students generate during their learning process and make predictions or assessments about student learning. We also present a new model in the way the learning process is evaluated. This model is more personal and contributes to new possibilities that the digital technologies offer in technology-enhanced assessment.

AB As educational data are being captured and made available, there is a demand for converting, translating, interpreting and presenting it for analysis in multiple ways. Aside from learning management systems, one rich source of data, but often uncollected, is educational games.
   This paper presents a learning analytics model as it applied in game-based learning environment. The proposed model presents a way to capture data from game events, e.g. the time spent in each game play and the number of times a help is acquired. The paper will also present a proof-of-concept implementation using game developed on iOS platform, using the built in Game Center feature to present the data collected.

AB Feedback is important for any activity, and learning is no exception. Whereas assessment can give summative feedback about the proficiency of the learning, learning analytics can give a much finer level of feedback about the learning process. Learning analytics can help in identifying the effectiveness of learning elements, can help in engaging students, can guide teachers in the preparation and deployment of the teaching activity. In this paper, we present a number of different initiatives carried out at UC3M that include elements of learning analytics for different purposes.

AB The importance of teachers in online learning is widely acknowledged to effectively support and stimulate learners. With the increasing availability of learning analytics data, online teachers might be able to use learning analytics dashboards to facilitate learners with different learning needs. However, deployment of learning analytics visualisations by teachers also requires buy-in from teachers. Using the principles of technology acceptance model, in this embedded case-study, we explored teachers' readiness for learning analytics visualisations amongst 95 experienced teaching staff at one of the largest distance learning universities by using an innovative training method called Analytics4Action Workshop. The findings indicated that participants appreciated the interactive and hands-on approach, but at the same time were skeptical about the perceived ease of use of learning analytics tools they were offered. Most teachers indicated a need for additional training and follow-up support for working with learning analytics tools. Our results highlight a need for institutions to provide effective professional development opportunities for learning analytics.

   Improvement
AB Learning in the workplace is crucial in higher engineering education, since it allows students to transfer knowledge and skills from university to professional engineering practice. Learning analytics endeavors in higher education have primarily focused on classroom-based learning. Recently, workplace learning analytics has become an emergent research area, with target users being workers, students and trainers. We propose technology for workplace learning analytics that allows program managers of higher engineering education programs to get insight into the workplace learning of their students, while ensuring privacy of students' personal data by design. Using a design-based agile methodology, we designed and developed a customizable workplace learning dashboard. From the evaluation with program managers in the computing domain, we can conclude that such technology is feasible and promising. The proposed technology was designed to be generaliz able to other (engineering) domains. A next logical step would be to evaluate and improve the proposed technology within other engineering domains.

AB Online education is one of the fastest emerging markets globally. There is a variety of tools, technologies and platforms, which augment learning in the online environments. Moodle and Sakai are probably the most popular open-source learning management systems (LMS) around the world, although there are alternative professional solutions such as TalentLMS or other platforms. Student interaction is one of the success factors of effective online teaching and learning. It is important to understand how students behave in an online environment. This provides good feedback to the syllabus developers and instructors, in order to examine what should be improved. The learning management systems provide a good way for analyzing learners' behavior through log reports. The LMS records all kinds of interactions by all users. These data are processed using learning analytics, in order to obtain a good picture of the progress achieved by the students during the lectures and the laboratories and of the manner in which the professors manage the students' learning curves. This paper explains the use of learning analytics in examining learners' engagement, interaction and behavior in an online environment. The results revealed interesting findings on how the assessment should be organized, in order to find maximum learning attainment.

AB In the last years, the use of Learning Analytics (LA) tools has been increasing to process the available information about students collected through different Learning Management Systems (LMS). In this study, we have analyzed the interactions in the educational scenario collected through Moodle (Modular Object Oriented Developmental Learning Environment), a leading open source LMS, in order to provide a classification of students by using clustering techniques, to improve the learning process. Students online activities generate large quantities of data that before were wasted since no LA tools were available to process them. With the irruption of the big data techniques in the educational sector, a lot of information can be easily treated to extract behaviors of the students and classify them according to their profiles.
   These analyses define models of action that help both the in-service teacher and the new teacher who joins the department. In addition, detailed analysis of this information may help us in the study of a possible relationship between different indicators of use of these platforms and the performance of students, both generated throughout the learning process as those coming from summative evaluation.
   In this study, we provide the construction of a data analysis model facilitated by the Moodle platform, from the different interactions between the teacher, the student and the developed subject; so that, this information can be transformed into knowledge and their understanding can help to the improvement of teaching practice. In particular, it addresses the application of these models to the improvement of the students' learning strategies according to their typology.

AB Online education is growing because of its benefits and advantages that students enjoy. Educational technologies (e.g., learning analytics, student modelling, and intelligent tutoring systems) bring great potential to online education. Many online courses, particularly in self-paced online learning (SPOL), face some inherent barriers such as learning awareness and academic intervention. These barriers can affect the academic performance of online learners. Recently, learning analytics has been shown to have great potential in removing these barriers. However, it is challenging to achieve the full potential of learning analytics with the traditional online course learning design model. Thus, focusing on SPOL, this study proposes that learning analytics should be included in the course learning design loop to ensure data collection and pedagogical connection. We propose a novel learning design-analytics model in which course learning design and learning analytics can support each other to increase learning success. Based on the proposed model, a set of online course design strategies are recommended for online educators who wish to use learning analytics to mitigate the learning barriers in SPOL. These strategies and technologies are inspired by Jim Greer's work on student modelling. By following these recommended design strategies, a computer science course is used as an example to show our initial practices of including learning analytics in the course learning design loop. Finally, future work on how to develop and evaluate learning analytics enabled learning systems is outlined.

AB A variety of tools are available to collect, process and analyse learning data obtained from the clickstream generated by students watching learning resources in video format. There is also some literature on the uses of such data in order to better understand and improve the teaching-learning process. Most of the literature focuses on large scale learning scenarios, such as MOOCs, where videos are watched hundreds or thousands of times. We have developed a solution to collect clickstream analytics data applicable to smaller scenarios, much more common in primary, secondary and higher education, where videos are watched tens or hundreds of times, and to analyse whether the solution is useful to teachers to improve the learning process. We have deployed it in a real scenario and collected real data. Furthermore, we have processed and presented the data visually to teachers for those scenarios and have collected and analysed their perception of their usefulness. We conclude that the collected data are perceived as useful by teachers to improve the teaching and learning process.

AB Increasingly, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are widely used and have become a key instrument in Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) models in the last few years. However, the key challenge with this kind of larger scales platforms is how to provide course participants with a quality learning materials that promote effective learning based on their needs. Indeed, this requires careful planning, monitoring and evaluation of all learning activities. Recently, learning analytics and Recommender systems are widely used in MOOCs to overcome this challenge in providing personalization and accessibility learning materials for course participants. The purpose of the current study was to determine the usability and effectiveness of a personalized links recommendation tool based on learning analytics in MOOCs. This personalized links recommendation tool was undertaken the power of crowd sourcing to provide course participants with an high quality learning material from externals recourses, e.g., Open Education Resources (OER). The present study makes several noteworthy contributions such as researching the mapping of learning data, an open personalized - links recommendation architecture, and a user-friendly and dynamic interface to deliver the recommendations.

AB In this paper, we propose the Social Semantic Server (SSS) as a service-based infrastructure for workplace and professional learning analytics (LA). The design and development of the SSS have evolved over eight years, starting with an analysis of workplace learning inspired by knowledge creation theories and their application in different contexts. The SSS collects data from workplace learning tools, integrates it into a common data model based on a semantically enriched artifact-actor network, and offers it back for LA applications to exploit the data. Further, the SSS design's flexibility enables it to be adapted to different workplace learning situations. This paper contributes by systematically deriving requirements for the SSS according to knowledge creation theories, and by offering support across a number of different learning tools and LA applications integrated into the SSS. We also show evidence for the usefulness of the SSS extracted from 4 authentic workplace learning situations involving 57 participants. The evaluation results indicate that the SSS satisfactorily supports decision making in diverse workplace learning situations and allow us to reflect on the importance of knowledge creation theories for this analysis.

AB The purpose of this paper is to mine or detect meaningful information for improving learning materials using e-book-based logs. The analysis and visualization methods of this study use association analysis with Apriori algorithm. Logs for e-book-based learning analytics were collected in an e-book system. In order to analyze and visualize the collected logs, this paper proposes a system called SILM (System for Improving Learning Materials). Using SILM, instructors or teachers can find the learning materials that should be improved. We believe that improving learning materials with analyzing and visualizing educational big data lead to improving student results.

AB Purpose One of the misconceptions of teaching and learning for practical-based programmes, such as engineering, sciences, architecture, design and arts, is the necessity to deliver via face-to-face physical modality. This paper refutes this claim by providing case studies of best practices in delivering such courses and their hands-on skillsets using completely online virtual delivery that utilises different formats of 2D and 3D media and tools, supported by evidence of efficiency using learning analytics. Design/methodology/approach The case studies were designed using pedagogical principles of constructivism and deep learning, conducted within a mixture of 2D and 3D virtual learning environments with flexible interface and tools capabilities. State-of-the-art coding and scripting techniques were also used to automate different student tasks and increase engagement. Regression and descriptive analysis methods were used for Learning Analytics. Findings Learning analytics of all case studies demonstrated the capability to achieve course/project learning outcomes, with high engagement from students amongst peers and with tutors. Furthermore, the diverse virtual learning tools used, allowed students to display creativity and innovation efficiently analogous to physical learning. Originality/value The synthesis of utilised media and tools within this study displays innovation and originality in combining different technology techniques to achieve an effectual learning experience. That would usually necessitate face-to-face, hands-on physical contact to perform practical tasks and receive feedback on them. Furthermore, this paper provides suggestions for future research using more advanced technologies.

AB This article sets out to explore learning design and learning analytics as central constructs in higher education. Both terms refer to ideas and frameworks of relevance for accountability and quality enhancement. While the constructs involve a range of multifaceted and complex themes, this study concentrates on task design as a key component in science and engineering education. Tasks and problems are used interchangeably, both referring to student activating resources. The purpose of the study is first to raise awareness of design by introducing sets of frameworks of relevance to science and engineering. Second, some evidence is included to demonstrate the applicability of categories of problem design to inform learning analytics.

AB Large swaths of data are readily available in various fields, and education is no exception. In tandem, the impetus to derive meaningful insights from data gains urgency. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in the area of voice and image recognition and so-called complete knowledge games like chess, go, and StarCraft, have resulted in a flurry of research. Using two educational datasets, we explore the utility and applicability of deep learning for educational data mining and learning analytics. We compare the predictive accuracy of popular deep learning frameworks/libraries, including, Keras, Theano, Tensorflow, fast.ai, and Pytorch. Experimental results reveal that performance, as assessed by predictive accuracy, varies depending on the optimizer used. Further, findings from additional experiments by tuning network parameters yield similar results. Moreover, we find that deep learning displays comparable performance to other machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes classifier, and logistic regression. We argue that statistical learning techniques should be selected to maximize interpretability and should contribute to our understanding of educational and learning phenomena; hence, in most cases, educational data mining and learning analytics researchers should aim for explanation over prediction.

AB Amount of educational data has been constantly increasing for years in all domains and kinds of education (formal or informal) and educational activities (teaching, learning, assessment, use of social media and collaboration and so on). Accordingly, Learning Analytics (LA) become a powerful mechanism for supporting learners, instructors, teachers, learning system designers and developers to better understand educational processes and predict learners' needs and performances. In this paper, we analyze the important dimensions and objectives of LA, application possibilities and some challenges to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. The required skills and capabilities that make meaningful use of LA techniques and technologies in this domain are considered and identified. Presented findings can act as a valuable guide for setting up LA services in support of educational practice. Also, they can be used as learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving learning process effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, this paper proposes the unavoidable constraints that affect LA technologies in education.

AB It is claimed that the innovative use of educational technology combined with appropriate pedagogical strategies can lead to improved student outcomes. However, teachers face difficulties in adopting educational technology and novel pedagogical methods as this involves acquiring complex new knowledge. Combined with training, Learning Analytics dashboards - artifacts which mediate teachers' learning in technology-enhanced environments - can aid them in this task. Using student engagement as an example, we present the prototype of a theory-driven dashboard that can help teachers to better understand and implement new instructional methods in technology-enhanced learning environments. We describe here our needs analysis, design, and evaluation process and outcomes, reflecting upon how teachers can benefit from using thoughtfully-designed LA dashboards in professional development scenarios.

AB Blended learning is gaining ground in contemporary education. However, studies on predictive learning analytics in the context of blended learning remain relatively scarce compared to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), where such applications have gained a strong foothold. Data sets obtained from blended learning environments suffer from a high dimensionality and typically expose a limited number of instances, which makes predictive analysis a challenging task. In this work, we explore the log data of a master-level blended course to predict the students' grades based entirely on the data obtained from an online module (a small private online course), using and comparing logistic regression and random forest-based predictive models. The results of the analysis show that, despite the limited data, success vs. fail predictions can be made as early as in the middle of the course. This could be used in the future for timely interventions, both for failure prevention as well as for reinforcing positive learning behaviours of students.

AB Learning analytics methods have proven useful in providing insights from the increasingly available digital data about students in a variety of learning environments, including serious games. However, such methods have not been applied to the specific context of educational escape rooms and therefore little is known about students' behavior while playing. The present work aims to fill the gap in the existing literature by showcasing the power of learning analytics methods to reveal and represent students' behavior when participating in a computer-supported educational escape room. Specifically, we make use of sequence mining methods to analyze the temporal and sequential aspects of the activities carried out by students during these novel educational games. We further use clustering to identify different player profiles according to the sequential unfolding of students' actions and analyze how these profiles relate to knowledge acquisition. Our results show that students' behavior differed significantly in their use of hints in the escape room and resulted in differences in their knowledge acquisition levels.

AB Extensive studies have been conducted to diagnose and predict students' academic performance by analyzing a large amount of data related to their learning behaviors in a blended learning environment. But there is a lack of research examining how individualized learning interventions could improve students' academic performance in such a learning context. In this study, a quasi-experiment was designed to investigate the effect of an individualized intervention approach on students' course performance and learning behaviors in a blended course. Forty-nine Chinese tertiary students undertaking the course were randomly assigned into two groups - the experimental and control groups. During the course, the experimental group received individualized interventions, while the control group received undifferentiated interventions. The data about these participants' learning behaviors were collected over 15 weeks. The results indicated that, compared with the control group, the experimental group showed significantly better academic performance, a higher level of learning motivation, attitude and self-efficacy, more active learning behaviors, and fewer passive learning behaviors. The control group revealed similar online learning time, but significantly more resource utilization and forum access. It is concluded that personalized learning intervention can effectively improve students' learning behaviors, attitude, motivation, self-efficacy, and academic performance in a blended learning environment.

AB It is becoming increasingly important not only in higher educational institutions but also in primary and secondary schools for students to learn proactively and autonomously. With this type of learning, it is essential for students to constantly reflect on their learning in order to adjust tasks and progress to the subsequent learning. However, when students reflect on learning, they often stick to the facts and their impressions of various activities. Thus, it is necessary for teachers to grasp the individual situation of each student, ideally through reading sentences of reflection on learning written by the student, and to facilitate reflection on learning appropriately. One promising direction is technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning that could be used to facilitate learning by analyzing large amounts of accumulated data. The purpose of this study is to develop a system that facilitates student reflection on learning by using a custom machine learning model. This model automatically classifies written sentences of reflection on learning with a focus on the different phases of reflection. We then facilitate further reflection on learning by grasping the situation from the classification result. In this paper, we describe the design and development of the system functions.

AB Student engagement within the development of learning analytics services in Higher Education is an important challenge to address. Despite calls for greater inclusion of stakeholders, there still remains only a small number of investigations into students' beliefs and expectations towards learning analytics services. Therefore, this paper presents a descriptive instrument to measure student expectations (ideal and predicted) of learning analytics services. The scales used in the instrument are grounded in a theoretical framework of expectations, specifically ideal and predicted expectations. Items were then generated on the basis of four identified themes (Ethical and Privacy Expectations, Agency Expectations, Intervention Expectations, and Meaningfulness Expectations), which emerged after a review of the learning analytics literature. The results of an exploratory factor analysis and the results from both an exploratory structural equation model and confirmatory factor analysis supported a two-factor structure best accounted for the data pertaining to ideal and predicted expectations. Factor one refers to Ethical and Privacy Expectations, whilst factor two covers Service Feature Expectations. The 12-item Student Expectations of Learning Analytics Questionnaire (SELAQ) provides researchers and practitioners with a means of measuring of students' expectations of learning analytics services.

DE personalization of education; adaptive learning; digital transformation;
   artificial intelligence; model of adaptive learning system
AB The article states that the main feature of modern learning is its personalized orientation, adaptability of the educational process to the student's individual needs. Such training is adaptive. Today, the vast majority of learning content for adaptive learning is characterized by rather primitive feedback relationship between the learner's personal needs and the adaptation of learning aiming at meeting those needs. Typically, this link is based on an analysis of the student's learning process, test results, and minor subjective factors, while current adaptive technologies allow for a more in-depth determination of the learning situation and students' individual characteristics. In our view, this problem can be solved by applying a number of tools and techniques, namely student's individual and typological characteristics, the ability to monitor the student's thinking, and adaptive analytics of the learning process. It is noted that one of the promising directions of providing adaptive learning conditions should be the creation of adaptive learning systems, the functioning of which is ensured by technologies using artificial intelligence. It is emphasized that the use of artificial intelligence in adaptive learning systems helps personalize the learning approach for each student in order to make learning as effective as possible. It is noted that the introduction of artificial intelligence should be aimed at preserving and enhancing all strong aspects of the teacher. The effectiveness of this process depends not only on which and how many ICTs are used in educational environments, but how well they are mastered by students, educators, research workers, and organizers of the educational process, how actively and pedagogically these technologies are applied. In view of these issues, a conceptual model for adaptive learning system is proposed and substantiated.

AB Software is an important aspect in the modern world because it uses by everyone and everywhere. Therefore software engineering education gets more important in the computer science curricula but it has lapses to produce good software engineers to the industries requirements. Learning analytics helps the students to improve their learning activities. This was analyzed among the software engineering students how the learning style influences in gathering knowledge. Forty six questionnaires were distributed to the first year MCA students in the Department of Computer Applications, Bharathiar University, Coimbatore, India for this study.

AB Increasing numbers of higher education institutions see themselves as service providers, catering primarily to the needs of its students. The improvement of student performance is a top priority for universities. It is critical to first assess the present situation of the students before designing a program to improve their performance. Higher education administrators face a significant problem in predicting a student's future success. The goal of this study is to learn what factors influence college students' decision on a major. It will be possible to forecast students' behavior, attitudes, and performance with the use of predictive tools and procedures. Predicting student performance ahead of time makes it possible to take proactive measures to raise achievement levels. To obtain a high education standard, several attempts have been made to forecast student performance. However the accuracy of these predictions falls short of the desired level of excellence. Machine learning approaches including Artificial Neural Network, Nave Bayes, and SVM are being studied. A University Data Set from UCI Machinery is used in the experimental investigation.

AB Improving quality of learning in online environments requires formative and summative assessments particular to its distinctive online learning nature and dynamics. Feedback mechanism about learning engagement could be a source of assessment for the educators and the students. In online learning, not only the educators but also the students need to get informed about their learning engagements as cyberspace is not controllable for the educators and students could be in interaction with any content or human agency without teacher guidance and in this context, feedback based on analytical assessment is essential for the self-learning activities. Sometimes, in online group discussions, the teachers may not decide when to interrupt the ongoing discussions and in parallel with this, the students in a learning group may be in a vicious circle and repeatedly discussing the same topic without any advancement whereas critical thinking skills require adaptation of some instructional strategies. In these occasions, learning analytics (LA) is a key process to provide educational stakeholders with evidence based, analytical and contextual outcomes in a way of making sense of their learning engagements. In this conceptual framework, our research has attempted to examine sequential analysis as a likely method to get adapted by LA researchers with its prospects, opportunities and challenges. To this end, we focused on a part of a blended learning course and analyzed the students' online discussions to examine the method of sequential analysis with its potential to be an efficient tool to conduct learning analytics. The outcomes of this study have implications for the design of an online learning environment as well as LA as an emerging area.

AB The main objective of this paper is to analyse the effect of the affordances of a virtual learning environment and a personal learning environment (PLE) in the configuration of the students' personal networks in a higher education context. The results are discussed in light of the adaptation of the students to the learning network made up by two undergraduate, inter-university and online courses. Besides, we also examine the influence of this effect in the learning process. The findings reflect the effectiveness of a PLE for facilitating student participation and for assisting students in the creation of larger and more balanced personal networks with richer social capital. However, the findings do not provide evidences about a difference in the learning performance between the two environments. From a methodological point of view, this paper serves as an illustration of the analysis of personal networks on digital data collected from technology-enhanced learning environments.

AB Online education has been going through numerous transformations as new and innovative technologies influence and shape new e-learning portals. Differentiated e-learning promises to add value and enhance the educational services provided by an academic institution. In this paper we present our online learning model that advocates and endorses differentiated learning as an e-learning affordance that has been facilitated through the development of new learning technologies. We demonstrate how the online portal enables and supports multiple instances whereby differentiated learning is applied and practiced, including through the use of a novel analytics tool that sums up the overall learner effort in one visual.
   The paper advances the notion of "productive diversity" in learning, replacing the templated sameness characterizing the communicative practices of "didactic pedagogy," including textbooks, lectures, tests. Today's computer-mediated, networked learning environments can support differentiated learning on a number of dimensions, where students are able to work at their own pace, choose their own topics within a general disciplinary rubric, and offer each other feedback in such a way that differences in perspective become a valuable resource for learning. The paper concludes by demonstrating a technology that attempts to translate these principles into practice-the CGScholar platform, including the high level progress visualizations it offers in its learning analytics.

AB Capacity building for Learning Analytics (LA) in Higher Education Institutions requires the coordination of organizational aspects and infrastructure development. This also depends on the organizational maturity of the institution and its leadership regarding LA adoption. LA capacity building can follow two approaches: (1) top-down, led by institutional managers; and (2) bottom-up, led by ground-level staff. This article studies two LA initiatives of each type conducted in the same institution to compare the deployment of organizational processes and infrastructure. The lessons learned that were captured from each approach are shared to inform other universities in Latin America on developing LA capabilities.

AB An important goal of learning analytics (LA) is to improve learning by providing students with meaningful feedback. Feedback is often generated by prediction models of student success using data about students and their learning processes based on digital traces of learning activities. However, early in the learning process, when feedback is most fruitful, trace-data-based prediction models often have limited information about the initial ability of students, making it difficult to produce accurate prediction and personalized feedback to individual students. Furthermore, feedback generated from trace data without appropriate consideration of learners' dispositions might hamper effective interventions. By providing an example of the role of learning dispositions in an LA application directed at predictive modeling in an introductory mathematics and statistics module, we make a plea for applying dispositional learning analytics (DLA) to make LA precise and actionable. DLA combines learning data with learners' disposition data measured through for example self-report surveys. The advantage of DLA is twofold: first, to improve the accuracy of early predictions; and second, to link LA predictions with meaningful learning interventions that focus on addressing less developed learning dispositions. Dispositions in our DLA example include students' mindsets, operationalized as entity and incremental theories of intelligence, and corresponding effort beliefs. These dispositions were inputs for a cluster analysis generating different learning profiles. These profiles were compared for other dispositions and module performance. The finding of profile differences suggests that the inclusion of disposition data and mindset data, in particular, adds predictive power to LA applications.

ID PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION
AB Online learning platforms gained popularity in recent years. These platforms often provide learning analytics, which offer educators prediction on students' progress. For this purpose, machine learning algorithms are employed. As machine learning reproduces bias from the training data, such systems can potentially deliver unfair or discriminatory results. If the system outcomes are used to provide assistance or guidance to learners or if they influence educators' grading decisions, biased predictions affect students notably. It is therefore necessary to assess the fairness of learning analytics systems, especially when they use machine learning. There are different ways to assess fairness of systems. In this paper, we discuss fairness assessment using code analysis. While it has been shown multiple times using real world training data that machine learning systems are biased and potentially unfair the objective of code analysis without the use of training data is to show the fairness of a system and its limitations. Code analysis thus complements the existing data driven fairness metrics. We propose a code analysis procedure to study the algorithmic fairness that consists of acquiring code and documentation, identifying and description of relevant system components, and fairness risk assessment. We conclude that the use of code analysis for the purpose of fairness auditing requires specialized knowledge about the application domain, programming, and machine learning. It is very time consuming and dependent on quality of code documentation. We apply this approach on Moodle, a widely used open-source platform, and propose a code analysis procedure to study the algorithmic fairness of Moodle learning analytics. We identify relevant components (learning analytics is only a tiny fraction of the Moodle system), exam their role, and discuss the effect of data and user on fairness. Our analysis shows that Moodle learning analytics does not use protected attributes such as age, gender, or ethnicity. However, users must be aware of other potential fairness aspects. Furthermore, user's knowledge about machine learning, and evaluation metrics effects the fairness.

AB Free Learning for Humanity (FLH) is a new initiative to bring free online learning, experience, and new forms of credentials to those without access to higher education from an accredited institution. FLH is resourced as part of a seed grant from IEEE New Initiatives Committee plus from a growing base of worldwide volunteers and organizations. FLH is not a program or a system, but rather a set of contributions to an ecosystem, which self-directed learners can draw from to meet their unique needs.
   The vision of free learning for all of humanity is widely embraced, and is now becoming more feasible with falling computer prices and the availability of the Internet and electricity in developing countries. OpenCourseWare (OCW) has been available from many sources for a decade, which FLH will leverage. However, learners still need an on-ramp to real world experience, the forthcoming IEEE Task Registry funded by same seed grant will provide. Online badges and certificates are becoming widely available and industry accepted, and FLH will leverage, but a composite credential is needed for those who learn as much as college graduates. Towards this end, FLH is setting up individuals with a Quality Management System (QMS) for their self-directed lifelong learning, for both the achievement of their learning and experience goals, and also for continually gaining new expertise needed by market changes, which builds on a recent pilot where a self-paced learner's QMS gained registration to ISO-9001, Quality Assurance. This, plus completing a college-equivalent online set of courses, work or volunteer experience, participation in a professional society, and commitment to a code of ethics could comprise a new professional certification that could serve those without affordable access to an accredited degree.
   FLH is working in close liaison with the IEEE Actionable Data Book (ADB), an activity conducted under the aegis of the IEEE Standards Association Industry Connections Program and the IEEE Learning Technology Standards Committee. The ADB goal is to define an open and transformative blend of mobile technology, experiential analytics for evidence-based management, and rich media, delivered through interactive e-book technology.
   FLH has kicked off a pilot with three participants from developing countries, who are being guided to set up a QMS for setting goals and objectives, selecting the best free online courses, applying for freelance or volunteer tasks to support their learning goals, and other elements of becoming a self-directed lifelong learner. An online course is being developed to guide others who follow.
   FLH welcomes new ideas, initiatives, capabilities, pilots, liaisons, and active participants in this new initiative.

AB While virtual reality has attracted educators' interest by providing new opportunities to the learning process and assessment in different science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects, the results from previous studies indicate that there is still much work to be done when large data collection and analysis is considered. At the same time, learning analytics emerged with the promise to revolutionise the traditional practices by introducing new ways to systematically assess and improve the effectiveness of instruction. However, the collection of 'big' educational data is mostly associated with web-based platforms (i.e., learning management systems) as they offer direct access to students' data with minimal effort. Thence, in the context of this work, we present a four-dimensional theoretical framework for virtual reality-supported instruction and propose a set of structural elements that can be utilised in conjunction with a learning analytics prototype system. The outcomes of this work are expected to support practitioners on how to maximise the potential of their interventions and provide further inspiration for the development of new ones.

ID EMERGENCE
AB Network analysis has contributed to the emergence of learning analytics. In this editorial, we briefly introduce network science as a field and situate it within learning analytics. Drawing on the Learning Analytics Cycle, we highlight that effective application of network science methods in learning analytics involves critical considerations of learning processes, data, methods and metrics, and interventions, as well as ethics and value systems surrounding these areas. Careful work must meaningfully situate network methods and interventions within the theoretical assumptions explaining learning, as well as within pedagogical and technological factors shaping learning processes. The five empirical papers in the special section demonstrate diverse applications of network analysis, and the invited commentaries from cognitive network science and physics education research further discuss potential synergies between learning analytics and other sister fields with a shared interest in leveraging network science. We conclude by discussing opportunities to strengthen the rigour of network-based learning analytics projects, expand current work into nascent areas, and achieve more impact by holistically addressing the full cycle of learning analytics.

AB The increasing progress in ubiquitous technology makes it easier and cheaper to track students' physical actions unobtrusively, making it possible to consider such data for supporting research, educator interventions, and provision of feedback to students. In this paper, we reflect on the underexplored, yet important area of learning analytics applied to physical/motor learning tasks and to the physicality aspects of 'traditional' intellectual tasks that often occur in physical learning spaces. Based on Distributed Cognition theory, the concept of Internet of Things and multimodal learning analytics, this paper introduces a theoretical perspective for bringing learning analytics into physical spaces. We present three prototypes that serve to illustrate the potential of physical analytics for teaching and learning. These studies illustrate advances in proximity, motion and location analytics in collaborative learning, dance education and healthcare training.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine student perceptions of privacy principles related to learning analytics. Privacy issues for learning analytics include how personal data are collected and stored as well as how they are analyzed and presented to different stakeholders. A total of 330 university students participated in an exploratory study confronting them with learning analytics systems and associated issues of control over data and sharing of information. Findings indicate that students expect learning analytics systems to include elaborate adaptive and personalized dashboards. Further, students are rather conservative in sharing data for learning analytics systems. On the basis of the relationship between the acceptance and use of learning analytics systems and privacy principles, we conclude that all stakeholders need to be equally involved when learning analytics systems are implemented at higher education institutions. Further empirical research is needed to elucidate the conditions under which students are willing to share relevant data for learning analytics systems.

AB This work provides an overview of an education and technology monitoring system developed at Plan Ceibal, a nationwide initiative created to enable technology enhanced learning in Uruguay. Plan Ceibal currently offers one-to-one access to technology and connectivity to every student and teacher (from primary and secondary education) as well as a comprehensive set of educational software platforms. All these resources generate massive amounts of data about the progress and style of students learning. This work introduces the conceptual framework, design and preliminary results of the Big Data Center for learning analytics currently being developed at Plan Ceibal. This initiative is focused on exploiting these datasets and conducting advanced analytics to support the educational system. To this aim, a 360 degrees profile will be built including information characterizing the user's online behavior as well as a set of technology enhanced learning factors. These profiles will be studied both at user (e.g., student or teacher) and larger scale levels (e.g., per school or school system), addressing both the need of understanding how technology is being used for learning as well as to provide accurate feedback to support evidence based educational policies.

AB Increasingly, student work is being conducted on computers and online, producing vast amounts of learning-related data. The educational analytics fields have produced many insights about learning based solely on tutoring systems' automatically logged data, or "log data." But log data leave out important contextual information about the learning experience. For example, a student working at a computer might be working independently with few outside influences. Alternatively, he or she might be in a lively classroom, with other students around, talking and offering suggestions. Tools that capture these other experiences have potential to augment and complement log data. However, the collection of rich, multimodal data streams and the increased complexity and heterogeneity in the resulting data pose many challenges to researchers. Here, we present two empirical studies that take advantage of multimodal data sources to enrich our understanding of student learning. We leverage and extend quantitative models of student learning to incorporate insights derived jointly from data collected in multiple modalities (log data, video, and high-fidelity audio) and contexts (individual vs. collaborative classroom learning). We discuss the unique benefits of multimodal data and present methods that take advantage of such benefits while easing the burden on researchers' time and effort.

AB In this paper, we discuss the design, development, and implementation of a Learning Analytics (LA) dashboard in the area of Higher Education (HE). The dashboard meets the demands of the different stakeholders, maximizes the mainstreaming potential and transferability to other contexts, and is developed in the path of Open Source. The research concentrates on developing an appropriate concept to fulfil its objectives and finding a suitable technology stack. Therefore, we determine the capabilities and functionalities of the dashboard for the different stakeholders. This is of significant importance as it identifies which data can be collected, which feedback can be given, and which functionalities are provided. A key approach in the development of the dashboard is the modularity. This leads us to a design with three modules: the data collection, the search and information processing, and the data presentation. Based on these modules, we present the steps of finding a fitting Open Source technology stack for our concept and discuss pros and cons trough out the process.

AB In this study, we analyse the relationship between engagement in a virtual learning environment (VLE) and module grades at a 'bricks-and-mortar' university in the United Kingdom. We measure VLE activity for students enrolled in 38 different credit-bearing modules, each of which are compulsory components of six degree programmes. Overall we find that high VLE activity is associated with high grades, but low activity does not necessarily imply low grades. Analysis of individual modules shows a wide range of relationships between the two quantities. Grouping module-level relationships by programme suggests that science-based subjects have a higher dependency on VLE activity. Considering learning design (LD), we find that VLE usage is more important in modules that adopt an instruction-based learning style. We also test the predictive power of VLE usage in determining grades, again finding variation between degree programmes and potential for predicting a student's final grade weeks in advance of assessment. Our findings suggest that student engagement with learning at a bricks-and-mortar university is in general hard to determine by VLE usage alone, due to the predominance of other "offline" learning activities, but that VLE usage can nonetheless help to predict performance for some disciplines.

ID SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY; TECHNOLOGY; MOTIVATION
AB Although blended learning has many opportunities for flexible learning, it also includes challenges. One of the major challenges is to keep students motivated. An opportunity often overlooked by educational scientists is the vast amount of data generated by learning management systems, or summarised in one word: Learning Analytics (LA). LA could be used to promote students' motivation by providing teachers insight into students' learning activities within a blended learning context. However, this research field is still underdeveloped. Little is known about students' perceptions of LA, but this information is fundamental to design supportive LA interventions. Therefore, in a first phase, this study aims to investigate how motivated student teachers are in a blended learning context. Following self-determination theory, this study examines whether the student teachers' basic needs are fulfilled. In a subsequent second phase, the student teachers' perceptions of a hypothetical use of LA are explored. In December 2016, a study was conducted in a blended learning setting in teacher education. The results indicate that student teachers' basic needs are not fulfilled. The second major finding suggests that student teachers have different opinions about the use of LA, and overall that the majority of the student teachers is not convinced about the added value. Yet, these perceptions are based on a hypothetical use of LA and not on student teachers' own experiences. Future research should investigate what student teachers' perceptions are after a LA intervention is conducted in the blended learning setting, and whether this intervention can give appropriate input to the teacher enabling him or her to better accommodate students' basic needs.

ID PREDICTION; AREA
AB This paper presents the findings of a mixed-methods research that explored the potentials emerging from aligning learning design (LD) and learning analytics (LA) during the design of a predictive analytics solution and from involving the instructors in the design process. The context was a past massive open online course, where the learner data and the instructors were accessible for posterior analysis and additional data collection. Through a close collaboration with the instructors, the details of the prediction task were identified, such as the target variable to predict and the practical constraints to consider. Two predictive models were built: LD-specific model (with features based on the LD and pedagogical intentions), and a generic model (with cumulative features, not informed by the LD). Although the LD-specific predictive model did not outperform the generic one, some LD-driven features were powerful. The quantity and the power of such features were associated with the degree to which the students acted as guided by the LD and pedagogical intentions. The leading instructor's opinion about the importance of the learning activities in the LD was compared with the results of the feature importance analysis. This comparison helped identify the problems in the LD. The implications for improving the LD are discussed.

AB This study investigates enhancing student learning and performance by exploring student motivation through the use of learning analytics. A mixed-methods approach will be used to collect data from Computer Science students within the UK higher education sector. The collected data will be analyzed using thematic analysis to develop a theoretical framework that will be tested subsequently using structural equation modeling. The identification of student motivation factors helps tutors and learning analysts to better understand student learning motivation and adapt their learning practices accordingly.

AB The collection and selection of the data used in learning analytics applications deserve more attention. Optimally, selection of data should be guided by pedagogical purposes instead of data availability. Using design science research methodology, we designed an artifact to collect time-series data on students' self-regulated learning and conceptual thinking. Our artifact combines curriculum data, concept mapping, and structured learning diaries. We evaluated the artifact in a case study, verifying that it provides relevant data, requires a limited amount of effort from students, and works in different educational contexts. Combined with learning analytics applications and interventions, our artifact provides possibilities to add value for students, teachers, and academic leaders.

AB In this paper, the researchers propose a conceptual for system architecture of learning analytics process in the intelligent learning environment. Within this concept, today's competitive business environment need for businesses in order to implement the monitor and analyze the user-generated data on their own and their competitors. The achievement of competitive advantage is often necessary to listen to and understand what customers are saying about competitors' products and services. Not only personality analytics but also the conceptual description can capture an intelligent learning environment, and it is the analytic tools that are used to improve learning and education. The researchers also discuss how learning analytics is developed in different fields. It closely tied to, a series of other fields of study including business intelligence, web analytics, academic analytics, educational data mining, and action analytics. The researchers believe that conceptual of personality analytics in the intelligent learning environment can play an essential role in managing and analyzing personality and contribute to the concept of personality analytics in the intelligent learning environment. The results of this research could be summarized as follows: learning analytics process should be used as measuring and collecting data about learners and learning with the aim of improving teaching and learning practice through analysis of the data. By achieving this process, it should collect data to report or analyze the happening about the learner. Then, instructors monitor learning what is happening now, while as learning analytics should get what is going to happen in the future for learners. Finally, instructors take action to feedback learners.

   Technology enhanced learning
AB Problem based learning (PBL) supports the development of transversal skills and could underpin the training of a workforce competent to withstand the constant generation of new information. However, the application of PBL is still facing challenges, as educators are usually unsure how to structure student-centred courses, how to monitor students' progress and when to provide guidance. Recently, the analysis of educational data, namely learning analytics (LA), has brought forth new perspectives towards informative course monitoring and design. However, existing research shows that limited studies have combined PBL with LA to explore their potential in offering data-driven, student-centred courses. This paper presents a framework, termed PBL_LA, that aims to address this gap by combining PBL with LA. The framework is populated from the literature and discussions with PBL and LA experts. The paper also presents results from redesigning, delivering and assessing ten courses in different disciplines and countries using the proposed framework. Results showed positive feedback on all different testing settings, exhibiting reliability of the framework and potential across countries, disciplines and sectors.

AB Learning Analytics (LA) and tools for intelligent analysis of data accumulated in the information systems used in higher education institutions (HEIs) provide an opportunity to increase the effectiveness of monitoring, management, quality assurance and evaluation of training delivered to all management groups which make decisions in higher education institutions - programme managers, faculty and university managers. The paper presents LA models and a correspondent software tool designed for the needs of decision making bodies in Bulgarian HEI (programme managers, deans and rector). The tool allows them to monitor the learning process and make timely data-driven decisions to improve institutional processes in many aspects. Research and experiments with the models and the LA tool under consideration are conducted on the basis of the information infrastructure of a typical Bulgarian university - University of Plovdiv "Paisii Hilendarski".

TI Framing Professional Learning Analytics as Reframing Oneself

AB Central to imagining the future of technology-enhanced professional learning is the question of how data are gathered, analyzed, and fed back to stakeholders. The field of learning analytics (LA) has emerged over the last decade at the intersection of data science, learning sciences, human-centered and instructional design, and organizational change, and so could in principle inform how data can be gathered and analyzed in ways that support professional learning. However, in contrast to formal education where most research in LA has been conducted, much work-integrated learning is experiential, social, situated, and practice-bound. Supporting such learning exposes a significant weakness in LA research, and to make sense of this gap, this article proposes an adaptation of the Knowledge-Agency Window framework. It draws attention to how different forms of professional learning locate on the dimensions of learner agency and knowledge creation. Specifically, we argue that the concept of "reframing oneself" holds particular relevance for informal, work-integrated learning. To illustrate how this insight translates into LA design for professionals, three examples are provided: first, analyzing personal and team skills profiles (skills analytics); second, making sense of challenging workplace experiences (reflective writing analytics); and third, reflecting on orientation to learning (dispositional analytics). We foreground professional agency as a key requirement for such techniques to be used effectively and ethically.

AB Learning analytic implementations are increasingly being included in learning management systems in higher education. We lay out some concerns with the way learning analytics - both data and algorithms - are often presented within an unproblematized Big Data discourse. We describe some potential problems with the often implicit assumptions about learning and learners - and indeed the tendency not to theorize learning explicitly - that underpin such implementations. Finally, we describe an attempt to devise our own analytics, grounded in a sociomaterial conception of learning. We use the data obtained to suggest that the relationships between learning and the digital traces left by participants in online learning are far from trivial, and that any analytics that relies on these as proxies for learning tends towards a behaviorist evaluation of learning processes.

AB Learning analytics (LA) is a promising tool to support learning and retention in studies; so far, many applications have been developed to make use of big data saved automatically while using online learning management systems. However, it is not clear how different applications support the contemporary learning approach or how they are valued by both teachers and students. Therefore, a qualitative study was conducted to explore university teachers' and students' expectations on LA. Several scenarios were provided to them in order to feed their ideas about the potential of LA. The results were linked to the characteristics of the contemporary learning approach. This showed that while self-regulation is the most often supported objective enhanced by LA, collaboration skills and subjective well-being need much more attention. It was also found that students were more positive than teachers in starting to use LA and teachers' opinions varied greatly.

AB The goal of AFEL is to develop, pilot and evaluate methods and applications, which advance informal/collective learning as it surfaces implicitly in online social environments. The project is following a multi-disciplinary, industry-driven approach to the analysis and understanding of learner data in order to personalize, accelerate and improve informal learning processes. Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining traditionally relate to the analysis and exploration of data coming from learning environments, especially to understand learners' behaviours. However, studies have for a long time demonstrated that learning activities happen outside of formal educational platforms, also. This includes informal and collective learning usually associated, as a side effect, with other (social) environments and activities. Relying on real data from a commercially available platform, the aim of AFEL is to provide and validate the technological grounding and tools for exploiting learning analytics on such learning activities. This will be achieved in relation to cognitive models of learning and collaboration, which are necessary to the understanding of loosely defined learning processes in online social environments. Applying the skills available in the consortium to a concrete set of live, industrial online social environments, AFEL will tackle the main challenges of informal learning analytics through 1) developing the tools and techniques necessary to capture information about learning activities from (not necessarily educational) online social environments; 2) creating methods for the analysis of such informal learning data, based on combining feature engineering and visual analytics with cognitive models of learning and collaboration; and 3) demonstrating the potential of the approach in improving the understanding of informal learning, and the way it is better supported; 4) evaluate all the former items in real world large scale applications and platforms.

AB This study explores the types of learning profiles that evolve from student use of video annotation software for reflective learning. The data traces from student use of the software were analysed across four undergraduate courses with differing instructional conditions. That is, the use of graded or non-graded self-reflective annotations. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, four profiles of students emerged: minimalists, task-oriented, disenchanted, and intensive users. Students enrolled in one of the courses where grading of the video annotation software was present, were exposed to either another graded course (annotations graded) or non-graded course (annotations not graded) in their following semester of study. Further analysis revealed that in the presence of external factors (i.e., grading), more students fell within the task-oriented and intensive clusters. However, when the external factor is removed, most students exhibited the disenchanted and minimalist learning behaviors. The findings provide insight into how students engage with the different features of a video annotation tool when there are graded or non-graded annotations and, most importantly, that having experience with one course where there are external factors influencing students' use of the tool is not sufficient to sustain their learning behaviour in subsequent courses where the external factor is removed.

AB We conducted a literature review on systems that track learning analytics data (e.g., resource use, time spent, assessment data, etc.) and provide a report back to students in the form of visualizations, feedback, or recommendations. This review included a rigorous article search process; 945 articles were identified in the initial search. After filtering out articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 94 articles were included in the fmal analysis. Articles were coded on five categories chosen based on previous work done in this area: functionality, data sources, design analysis, perceived effects, and actual effects. The purpose of this review is to identify trends in the current student-facing learning analytics reporting system literature and provide recommendations for learning analytics researchers and practitioners for future work.

AB Due to high volume, velocity, and variety (referred to as "3V") of data production, the term "big data" has recently emerged. Because of such fast data growth, Data centers of educational institutions are seemingly exploding as well. Therefore, big data is making its way to the field of E-learning. Nowadays large educational institutions feel the urgent need to analyze this flood of data to provide students with higher quality of services. Despite the fact that there is huge volume and variety of data with high velocity of production, the existing traditional methods are unable to analyze such data. In other words, there is little done on implementing learning analytics on big data engines. The author created a scalable machine learning system on a cluster of three machines suitable for large dataset operations using big data engine and implemented an early warning process with machine learning techniques. The dataset was obtained from online and semionline courses from The University of Tehran. Many features like access time, history of access and history of actions of students were extracted and used for the classification task. A parallel distributed classification process was run to predict students' success and failures. It offers a fast, scalable and in-memory process with apache Spark. Eventually, the research compares the efficiency of proposed method with current and common methods'. The results reveal that our model had a high classification accuracy and the larger the dataset, the more efficient our process will be. It also discusses a new term "learning analytic" and "big data" that are completely new and worth reading. My paper contains worthy information about implementing ELearning data mining on big data engines.

AB This paper reports the findings of a research using marks of students in learning activities of an online module to build a predictive model of performance for the final assessment of the module. The objectives were (1) to compare the performances of students of two cohorts in terms of continuous learning assessment marks and final learning activity marks and (2) to model their final performances from their learning activities forming the continuous assessment using predictive analytics and regression analysis. The findings of this study combined with other findings as reported in the literature demonstrate that the learning design is an important factor to consider with respect to application of learning analytics to improve teaching interventions and students' experiences. Furthermore, to maximise the efficiency of learning analytics in eLearning environments, there is a need to review the way offline activities are to be pedagogically conceived so as to ensure that the engagement of the learner throughout the duration of the activity is effectively monitored.

AB The growing practice of students as partners (SaP) has sparked numerous conversations in higher education about the roles students do and should play in shaping the future. SaP scholars contend that by engaging with students in meaningful partnership, underpinned by values such reciprocity, students can have deeper and more meaningful learning experiences. Similar in this goal, the field of learning analytics also strives to create deeper and more meaningful learning experiences for students, however, the current approach differs. Students and other stakeholders such as teachers are rarely part of the process in learning analytics, and this divide, and lack of communication, between designers and users, has led to several critical issues in the area. Therefore, this paper will discuss three ongoing issues within learning analytics and draw on SaP values and guiding principles, such as reciprocity, emphasis on the process, and shared responsibility to question the current way learning analytics perceives students. By arguing for a change in perspective and the adoption of SaP in learning analytics, we will further add on growing literature about the importance of universities to become transparent and collaborative communities.

AB Depending on their motivational dispositions, students choose different learning strategies and vary in their persistence in reaching learning outcomes. As learning is more and more facilitated through technology, analytics approaches allow learning processes and environments to be analyzed and optimized. However, research on motivation and learning analytics is at an early stage. Thus, the purpose of this quantitative survey study is to investigate the relation between students' motivational dispositions and the support they perceive through learning analytics. Findings indicate that facets of students' goal orientations and academic self-concept impact students' expectations of the support from learning analytics. The findings emphasize the need to design highly personalized and adaptable learning analytics systems that consider students' dispositions and needs. The present study is a first attempt at linking empirical evidence, motivational theory, and learning analytics.

AB This paper shows how information about the student's learning behavior may be collected and evaluated by using a self-learning module. Based on this evaluation, some use cases are considered for a further development of the self-learning module. In this paper these use cases are presented from the teacher's and the student's point of view. Their advantages and implications are discussed. The paper closes with a short discussion of risks and potential disadvantages of learning analytics.

DE Learning Analytics; Learners; Teaching; Prediction; Algorithm
AB In the 21st century, with the growing importance of education and the increase use of internet, Learning Management Systems (LMS) or Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) have become a must amongst learners and instructors. One of the main objectives of these platforms is to implement technology with traditional learning methods so as to enhance the effectiveness of learning and teaching particularly in large cohorts of students. But does that really help to improve the process of learning? To be able to answer, Learning Analytics is perhaps the right tool. This area of study is concerned with the improvement of learning through the analysis of massive amount of data and information generated by the teaching and learning process. This paper demonstrates a prototype implementation of Learning Analytics, named TrueSight Learning and eventually shows how it can be used to predict the learning outcomes of learners and to identify the learners that are at risk and that will perhaps need special attention and double effort.

AB When used for education, games can increase students' motivation and engagement and provide a more authentic learning environment where they can apply knowledge, making them especially suited to schools. However, actual application of such (serious) games in schools is still limited. Teachers still consider that using games is a complex process that they do not fully master and that requires extra effort from them. We consider that simplifying teachers' tasks when deploying games is crucial to promote their use. In classroom scenarios, teachers can greatly benefit from knowing what is happening as a serious game is being played. Game learning analytics (GLA) is the process of collecting, analyzing and displaying student interaction data with the games to improve the educational experience. GLA can be used both at real-time, providing teachers with information while their students are still playing, and offline, inspecting already-finished game sessions. In both cases, analytics is only useful when it manages to bridge the gap between large collections of interaction data and pedagogically sound insight. Analytics dashboards should therefore provide not only complete but meaningful and easy-to-understand information, considering that teachers will most probably not know all the details of the analyses performed underneath. In this paper, we review our experiences on game learning analytics dashboards for teachers, and describe some of the steps we have taken to improve our dashboards.

AB In this paper, we set out a collaborative autoethnographic account of our reflective journey to deeper understandings of open, distance and e-learning (ODeL) through enrolling, participating and completing the first module in a course on technology-enhanced learning (TEL). As authors, we both enrolled for the course for different reasons. The course was offered by an outside institution, as part of capacity building at our university. The course, conducted fully online, was highly interactive and participatory. Through our participation, collaboration, reflection and experiences in the first module of the course, we were encouraged to develop written definitions of 'distance education' (DE) and 'technology-enhanced learning' (TEL). Our approach to studying our definitions was analytic, even though we were both participants and researchers. The analysis was based on the Community of Inquiry framework. Our findings reveal that our definitions evolved to include deeper, more complex, more comprehensive notions of DE and TEL. The analysis also revealed an unfolding of the definitions within our own contexts. We recommend that professional development of ODeL practitioners and stakeholders take place through being a student in an active, collaborative ODeL environment to enhance take-up practices.

ID HIGHER-EDUCATION
AB The diversity of student needs has been shown to impact on their proficiency in the use of digital technologies and calls into question the popular rhetoric that students entering universities today are already literate in digital skills and thus able to engage effectively in technology enhanced learning. Personalized learning environments (PLEs) are seen to offer great promise in meeting the individual needs of learners from diverse backgrounds and learning analytics can play an important role in informing the design and development of curricula to accommodate such diversity. This paper draws on the literature and previous research undertaken by the author to outline a holistic model to the design and development of inclusive technology enhanced learning environments. A recently funded Australian learning and teaching project(i), which employs the proposed approach is outlined and a conceptual model of a personalized learning environment under development is described. The PLE under development aims to addresses the diversity of students learning styles, digital literacy, English language proficiency, access to technologies, and accessibility requirements through a responsive learning system that has been informed by and based on the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII)(ii) software and service enhancement project, which 'aims to allow users to invoke and use the access features they need anywhere, anytime, on any device' [1]. The final section of the paper discusses the proposed direction of the project and the potential benefits it affords in improving learning outcomes and promoting the scholarship of teaching and learning.

AB A fixed learning path for all learners is a major drawback of virtual learning systems. An online learning path recommendation system has the advantage of offering flexibility to select appropriate learning content. Learning Analytics Intervention (LAI) provides several educational benefits, particularly for low-performing students. Researchers employed an LAI approach in this work to recommend personalised learning paths to students pursuing online courses depending on their learning styles. It was accomplished by developing a Learning Path Recommendation Model (LPRM) based on the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM) and evaluating its efficacy. The data were analysed with the help of a dataset from the Moodle Research Repository, and different learning paths were recommended using a sequence matching algorithm. The effectiveness of this approach was tested in two groups of learners using the independent two-sample t-test, a statistical testing tool. The experimental evaluation revealed that learners who followed the suggested learning path performed better than those who followed the learning path without any recommendations. This enhanced learning performance exemplifies the effects of learning analytics intervention.

AB Emerging technological advancements can play an essential role in overcoming challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a promising educational technology field, Learning Analytics (LA) tools or systems can offer solutions to COVID-19 pandemic-related needs, obstacles, and expectations in higher education. In the current study, we systematically reviewed 20 papers to better understand the responses of LA tools to the online learning challenges that higher education students, instructors, and institutions faced during the pandemic. In addition, we attempted to provide key cases in which LA has been effectively deployed for various purposes during the pandemic in the higher education context. We found out several prominent challenges for stakeholders. Accordingly, learners needed of timely support and interaction, and experienced difficulty of time management. Instructors lacked pedagogical knowledge for online teaching. In particular, individual and collaborative assessment have been a challenge for them. Institutions have not been ready for a digital transformation and online teaching. In response to these challenges, LA tools have been deployed for the following opportunities: monitoring, planning online learning process, fostering learners' engagement and motivation, facilitating assessment process; increasing interaction, improving retention, being easy to use. Understanding these promises can also give insight into future higher education policies.

AB Learning analytics is a research area that targets the problem of tracking and evaluating students learning progress. In case of educational games, traditional analytic tools can prove insufficient. Electronic games are dynamic, packed with action and learning is integral part of gameplay. Such a specific learning environment requires a specific real-time analytical tool that will adequately match the dynamic game environment. This paper presents a new form of specific visualization tool for educators to track students learning progress in real-time, while in gameplay session. The tool is based on the specially designed students learning model. Same tool can be used by students to track the game progress. Use of this tool provides educators with real-time tracking of students learning and enables them to react and influence the overall learning process.

AB Owing to its high promises for improving learning support, teaching, and learning outcomes in higher education, learning analytics has captured much interest from both academics and practitioners over the last several years. Considering that it is rooted in several disciplines, researchers and practitioners have approached learning analytics from a range of perspectives. Although many studies concerning learning analytics have highlighted its great potential for improving learning practice, there is little evidence of successful transfer of the suggested potential into the practice of higher education happening. This clearly indicates a need for rethinking many aspects of learning analytics usage: first, the goals that can be achieved, but also the actions necessary to attain these goals. The aim of the descriptive research presented in this paper is to provide an updated and realistic view of the state of the art in learning analytics, its potential benefits, and tangible challenges that need to be overcome for a successful application of learning analytics as educational technology.

AB Two cases of context-sensitive mobile computing curricula for children are shown to develop analytical understandings of how science-related sense-making talk can be supported through physical and digital environment interaction, which supports play and learning through movement. Our work investigates how proximity-based computing mediates children?s engagement in scientific sense-making conversations in a botanical garden. We draw upon sociocultural perspectives on sense-making talk as well as learning on-the-move to inform our study design. Data are from children in summer camp, including field notes, photographs, and video records (26 children in Case A, 24 in Case B) in an Arboretum. Our findings illustrate that children engaged in both playful and scientific sense-making talk in two distinct curricular tasks. We provide insights into science sense-making talk patterns and pedagogical practices of integrating learning on-the-move strategies into informal education with design principles related to augmenting gardens with digital content. Our results suggest that learning on-the-move strategies influence sense-making talk and that embodied interactions within the gardens support science sense-making and role-play. We posit that designs for learner-centered mobile computing can create digital-physical hybrid spaces where learners engage each other and natural objects as they walk through community spaces.

AB The use of online learning systems has proliferated, which has caused an explosion of generated data. The use of learning analytics to sort through this data for valuable performance-enhancing insights is fast becoming the norm. Although many research works are published on learning analytics, there is still a lack of research that identifies learning analytics features as a significant influencing factor in improving educator satisfaction. The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of learning analytics features that leads to a successful implementation of learning analytics for online learning systems. A survey involving 134 educators from 17 public and private higher education institutions in Malaysiawas conducted. Data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling-method, and the results showed a significant influence of learning analytics on educator satisfaction. This empirical evidence gives insight into the development of successful learning analytics for online learning systems.

DE Social media; Web 2.0; learning analytics; data mining for e-learning;
   learning dashboards
AB The role of social media in higher education has shifted from providing a web 2.0 solution for supporting communication in computer supported learning to more advanced functionalities including virtual learning environment tools (e.g. content sharing, threaded discussions). This paper discusses how analysis of social media usage can equip tutors with visual probes to identify areas that may need attention. The paper also describes how data mining can be used to assess communication patterns in computer supported collaborative learning (e.g. issues associated with content, learning activities or student competencies).
   The data collected from Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn have been analysed using various statistical techniques to identify group cohesion, communication pattern, student interactions with and use of the different types of social media. Current work presented in the paper includes the statistical analysis of data communication between small student groups or student pairs from a cohort of more than 200 final year students studying information systems, over a two-year period. The scope of the analysis was to assess how different learning tasks affected individual and group contributions as well as the impact of specific learning activities on tasks such as commenting, sharing, linking and liking. The investigation also considered how keywords were used, indicating how social media interaction was affected by the subjects covered during specific learning weeks.
   Building on previous work by the authors, this paper tests metrics identified previously for use in a learning analytics dashboard. The data includes attributes, which identify students' usage of social media such as total tweets, Facebook posts and LinkedIn projects, submitted by students over a period of 24 learning weeks over 7-8 months, during the two academic years 2014-15 and 2015-16.
   Data mining techniques are used to investigate whether metric, identified before, are useful in predicting student's results in terms of engagement, involvement, participation, contribution and communication. These are some of the factors that may affect the learning experience when integrating Web 2.0 technologies with traditional virtual learning environments. Current work also discussed the design of learning dashboards, to identify student's results in real time (i.e. identifying those students who are likely to fail or need additional support), as ways to implement learning analytics in the curriculum.

AB Big data in education promotes access to the analysis of learning behavior, yielding many valuable analysis results. However, with obscure and insufficient guidelines commonly followed when applying the analysis results, it is difficult to translate information knowledge into actionable strategies for educational practices. This study aimed to solve this problem by utilizing the learning analytics (LA) framework. We proposed a learning analytics framework based on human-centered Artificial Intelligence (AI) and emphasized its analysis result application step, highlighting the function of this step to transform the analysis results into the most suitable application strategy. To this end, we first integrated evidence-driven education for precise AI analytics and application, which is one of the core ideas of human-centered AI (HAI), into the framework design for its analysis result application step. In addition, a cognitive load test was included in the design. Second, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework and application strategy, two independent experiments were carried out, while machine learning and statistical data analysis tools were used to analyze the emerging data. Finally, the results of the first experiment revealed a learning strategy that best matched the analysis results through the application step in the framework. Further, we conclude that students who applied the learning strategy achieved better learning results in the second experiment. Specifically, the second experimental results also show that there was no burden on cognitive load for the students who applied the learning strategy, in comparison with those who did not.

AB We propose that the design and implementation of effective Social Learning Analytics (SLA) present significant challenges and opportunities for both research and enterprise, in three important respects. The first is that the learning landscape is extraordinarily turbulent at present, in no small part due to technological drivers. Online social learning is emerging as a significant phenomenon for a variety of reasons, which we review, in order to motivate the concept of social learning. The second challenge is to identify different types of SLA and their associated technologies and uses. We discuss five categories of analytic in relation to online social learning; these analytics are either inherently social or can be socialised. This sets the scene for a third challenge, that of implementing analytics that have pedagogical and ethical integrity in a context where power and control over data are now of primary importance. We consider some of the concerns that learning analytics provoke, and suggest that Social Learning Analytics may provide ways forward. We conclude by revisiting the drivers and trends, and consider future scenarios that we may see unfold as SLA tools and services mature.

AB Currently, competence-based learning is becoming very popular and systems that support this process are needed. Technology enhanced educational systems can notably improve the teaching and learning processes in the context of competence-based learning. In this paper, we present a system called COBLE (Competence-Based Learning Environment) that supports competence-based learning and combines visual learning analytics and recommendation aspects in order to promote the students' and lecturers' self-reflection about the learning and teaching processes.

AB To support online learners at a large scale, extensive studies have adopted machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze students' artifacts and predict their learning outcomes automatically. However, limited attention has been paid to the fairness of prediction with ML in educational settings. This study intends to fill the gap by introducing a generic algorithm that can orchestrate with existing ML algorithms while yielding fairer results. Specifically, we have implemented logistic regression with the Seldonian algorithm and compared the fairness-aware model with fairness-unaware ML models. The results show that the Seldonian algorithm can achieve comparable predictive performance while producing notably higher fairness.

AB This chapter focuses on the challenges of measuring self-regulatory processes and learning outcomes while learning from multiple representations with advanced learning technologies (ALTs). More specifically, we present challenges associated with measuring learners' processes and outcomes while using multiple representations with ALTs. ALTs are technology-based learning and training systems designed to teach learners of all ages to learn, reason, problem solve, and understand different topics and domains such as physics, math, history, biology, medicine and can include different systems such as multimedia, hypermedia, serious games, simulations, intelligent tutoring systems, immersive virtual environments and so forth. The structure of our chapter is as follows: (1) a brief overview of the major issues related to using multiple representations for learning with ALTs; (2) a description of the analytical techniques for understanding multiple representations and their goals for successful learning with ALTs; (3) a discussion of the issues associated with using multiple representations to measure and assess learning outcomes and how we can use ALTs as research tools to capture self-regulated learning; and (4) a presentation of challenges and future directions that need to be addressed by researchers.

AB In this study the authors conducted an empirical, bibliometric analysis of current literature in learning analytics. The authors performed a citation network analysis and found three dominant clusters of research. A qualitative thematic review of publications in these clusters revealed distinct context, goals, and topics. The largest cluster focused on predicting student success and failure, the second largest on using analytics to inform instructional design, and the third on concerns in implementing learning analytics systems. The authors suggest that further collaboration with educational technology researchers and practitioners may be necessary for learning analytics to reach its interdisciplinary goal. The authors also note that learning analytics currently does not often take place in K-12 settings, and that the burden of creating learning interventions still seemed to reside mainly with practitioners.

DE learning style; teaching-learning process; teacher education students
AB This study was conducted to look on the learning styles of the teacher education students which served as basis in improving the teaching and learning process. Specifically, it described the students' socio-demographic profile and their learning styles. The implications of learning styles to the instruction process were also given as well as some proposed strategies to improve the instruction process which is congruent to the learning styles of the students.
   This study was anchored on Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences which states that human beings have nine different kinds of intelligence that reflect different ways of interacting with the world. The types of intelligence that a person possesses (Gardner suggests most of us are strong in three types) indicates not only a persons capabilities, but also the manner or method in which they prefer to learn and develop their strengths.
   Results of the study showed that majority of the respondents are 16-17 years old; belong to a family with Php10,000 and below monthly income; with 4-5 siblings in the family; parents are high school level or high school graduates; and fathers are engaged in fanning while mothers are housewives.
   Learning styles of the students in terms of learning environment showed that majority prefers to learn in a quiet environment; well lighted room; with cool temperature; sitting in soft chairs or pillows; and in informal setting. In terms of emotional preferences; majority are self motivated; prefers to study lesson one at a time; prefers to study without being reminded; and prefers to be told exactly what and how to do things. In terms of social preferences, most prefers to study and learn by pair. In terms of physiological preferences, most prefers to learn by doing things; eating or munching while studying; prefers to study in the morning; and with less break and movements. While in terms of psychological preferences, majority are analytic or they prefer to learn sequentially and reflective or they take time to make decisions. (C) 2013 The Authors.

ID PARTICIPATION
AB This paper analyses the distribution of employment-related organised education and informal learning in the Canadian workforce. The paper draws on a large-scale survey, the Changing Nature of Work and Lifelong Learning (WALL), which was based on structured and standardised telephone interviews with a representative sample of 5783 Canadian members of the employed labour force. In exploring the determinants facilitating employment-related informal learning, three analytical categories of factors derived from previous research on learning participation were used: individual-level factors, job characteristics and workplace environment. The analyses focus on differences in individuals, jobs and workplace characteristics among adult workers who acquired or improved their job-related skills through different training pathways. In addition, analyses were performed to compare the extent to which these factors differ in their influence on learning decisions among workers who combine both organised education and informal learning and those who receive only informal learning. The results indicate that important predictors of participation in employment-related organised education and informal learning are age, educational attainment, learning skills, occupational class, education-job relation, degree of autonomy, degree of labour intensity, principal area of production and organisation size.

AB Although technological advances have brought about new opportunities for scaling feedback to students, there remain challenges in how such feedback is presented and interpreted. There is a need to better understand how students make sense of such feedback to adapt self-regulated learning processes. This study examined students' sense-making of learning analytics-based personalised feedback across four courses. Results from a combination of thematic analysis and epistemic network analysis show an association between student perceptions of their personalised feedback and how these map to subsequent self-described self-regulated learning processes. Most notably, the results indicate that personalised feedback, elaborated by personal messages from course instructors, helps students refine or strengthen important forethought processes of goal-setting, as well as to reduce procrastination. The results highlight the need for instructors to increase the dialogic element in personalised feedback in order to reduce defensive reactions from students who hold to their own learning strategies. This approach may prompt reflection on the suitability of students' current learning strategies and achievement of associated learning goals.
   Implications for practice or policy:
   Personalised feedback based on learning analytics should be informed by an understanding of students' self-regulated learning.
   Instructors implementing personalised feedback should align this closely with the course curriculum.
   Instructors implementing personalised feedback in their courses should consider the relational element of feedback by using a positive tone.
   Personalised feedback can be further enhanced by increasing the dialogic element and by including more information about learning strategies.

   Machine learning; Optimisation
AB Learning analytics (LA) is a relatively new research field concerned with analysing data collected from various sources to provide insights into enhancing learning and teaching. A complete LA process typically involves five distinct, yet interrelated, stages - namely capture, report, predict, act and refine - which form a sequential decision process. So far, research efforts have focused mostly on studying independent research questions involved in individual stages. It is therefore necessary to have a formal framework to quantify and guide the whole LA process. In this paper, we discuss how reinforcement learning (RL), a subfield of machine learning, can be employed to address the sequential decision problem involved in the LA process. In particular, we integrate the LA stages with an RL framework consisting of state space, action space, transition function and reward function and illustrate this with examples of how the three most studied optimality criteria in RL - finite horizon, discounted infinite horizon and the average reward model - can be applied to the LA process. The underlying assumptions, advantages and issues in the proposed RL framework are also discussed.

AB It is already commonly accepted, that blended learning seems to be one of the modern and promising approaches to teaching and learning. Blended learning aims to integrate traditional learning with innovative means, such as e-learning, analytics, game-based learning, and open educational resources, in order to create a new learning environment aiming to enhance learning effectiveness, and enrich learning experience. In the meantime, as one important and applicable output of the smart environments research, the concept of smart learning environments has evolved with a number of successful applications. The aim of this paper is to argue, that blended learning concept can be viewed as a promising perspective for affective learning strategies inclusion into recently more and more popular smart learning environments.

DE Learning analytics; Learning analytics dashboard; Evaluation
ID EDUCATION; DESIGN
AB Learning analytics provides a potential for adapting learning, teaching and knowledge testing processes to individual needs. One of the ways of using learning analytics is a dashboard for providing feedback to students and teachers. This paper presents the development and evaluation of the learning analytics dashboard for students (LAD-S). The LAD-S displays three views: a look at student success, system activities and prediction based on machine learning algorithms. We have used LAD-S as a part of Moodle online courses, one during the second semester in the 2020/2021, and the other two during the first semester in the 2021/2022. A survey was designed to examine students' opinion about the LAD-S that included student's self-awareness, influence of the dashboard on learning effectiveness, satisfaction with the type of data collected, usefulness and ease-of-use, intention to use the learning analytics dashboard. Data from 33 undergraduate and graduate students were collected. The results have shown that students are satisfied with all examined aspects of the LAD-S above the average. Students express the greatest satisfaction for ease of use (M = 3.79), clarity of collected data (M = 3.6), usefulness (M = 3.6), SUS questionnaire ( M = 3.6), behavioral intention (M = 3.4) and satisfaction with individual functions of LAD-S (M= 3.4). Lower, yet above-average satisfaction was obtained for the impact of the LAD-S on more effective learning (M = 3.2); intention to use (M = 3.3) and satisfaction with the possibility of behavioral changes (M = 3.1). To verify the reliability of the measures used, the Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient was calculated for each scale. Satisfactory reliability of all measures used was obtained, with alpha coefficients ranging from 0.704 for the SUS questionnaire to 0.942 for the ease-of-use measure.

AB This study examines the effects of using learning analytics (LA) in a mobile-based learning setting on students' self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, motivations, and academic achievements. For this objective, a mobile-based learning setting has been designed within the scope of the research, and LA and student data have been analyzed. The study was conducted on forty-nine university students at a state university in Eastern Europe taking a computer I course. While twenty-four students formed the control group, twenty-five students formed the experimental group of the research using random allocation. The control and experimental groups received education in mobile-based learning settings for one academic term. While the experimental group students have been given weekly LA about their learning behavior in the mobile-based learning setting as feedback, LA feedback has not been sent to the control group students. The research has been envisaged as an experimental design. The quantitative data have been collected through the SRL scale, personal information form, motivation scale, and academic achievement test. In conclusion, it has been observed that providing LA feedback with students in a mobile learning setting has created a statistically significant difference in SRL skills and academic achievement in favor of the experimental group students. Nevertheless, there was no statistical difference between experimental and control group students regarding motivation toward the lesson. Based on the research findings, what can be done in the design, use, and evaluation of feedback messages for LA-based interventions to be made to students in mobile learning environments has been discussed. It has been evaluated how LA-based interventions should be made in the context of universal access and design. In line with the findings obtained from the research, various suggestions were made for researchers and teachers regarding the educational use of LA-based interventions.

ID SERIOUS GAME; COMPUTER GAMES
AB Serious games have proven several advantages when used in education improving students learning. However, games are still complex to deploy in the class for average teachers. Many teachers still do not see games as a powerful tool to improve their teaching work. To this end, it is essential to humanize the game technology making the use of games more transparent to teachers in a way that they get the benefits and avoid most of the game deployment complexity. We consider that Game Learning Analytics is one of the keys to help teachers in the application of serious games in the classrooms. Game Learning Analytics allows to capture data from students' interactions with games and derive information that simplify teachers' tasks. Doing it in a transparent way within the game environment (i.e. stealth assessment) can provide evidence-based data about the learners' knowledge at each point of time. Combining both game learning analytics in near real-time and offline, and stealth assessment for games, it could be possible to leverage their use in classroom settings at real-time making their use easier for teachers.

AB The purpose of this research is to present an analytical model that can classify learning materials and identify the content presentation of the format suitable for students with what learning style according to the VARK learning style. The steps begin with the classification of learners' patterns with the VARK questionnaire from a sample group then, using online learning material, the learning achievement of each classified group is analyzed. By comparison, each group learning achievements found that online lessons on Multimedia Design and Development are suitable for the group of students with a quadmodal learning style, which has four learning styles in both Visual, Aural, Read/Write and Kinesthetic got higher learning achievement. Learning from an achievement from learner groups with other learning styles from these experimental results can present an analysis model that can be used to classify the learning materials. The initial step is classifying the learner's learning style with the theory or tools used to classify learning patterns. The next step is using the learning materials that need to be analyzed with the learner's group to get learning achievement, then compare between learners' groups achievement according to different learning styles that are classified. The results are showing that learning material is suitable for learners of what learning style, which will make better learning achievement.

ID MEAN SHIFT
AB Along with the growing popularity of the adaptive learning platform software in STEM education programs, further enhancing the ability of the adaptive learning platform to support learning effectiveness has become a priority. A common goal of all the adaptive learning platform software is to identify gaps in a student's knowledge, and provide relevant learning materials based on the result of the assessment of the student's exiting knowledge towards to the targeted subject, to increase the learning effectiveness. However, the student's existing knowledge is only one learning attribute, and it cannot reflect all the aspects that have an impact to the student's learning effectiveness. A natural solution to overcome this weakness is to make the adaptive learning decision making algorithm capable to process the dataset of multiple learning attributes of the student efficiently. This paper presents a machine learning algorithm to efficiently process the dataset of a student's multiple learning attributes. The main enabling foundation for this new algorithm is a data structure called "student learning attributes index" which represents every learning attribute as a tuple of three elements: the "learning-attribute-ID", the "weight" of the learning attribute among all the learning attributes, and the "efficiency" of the contribution to the student's learning effectiveness made by the learning attribute. This study has applied unequal weight to each of the learning attributes, more accurately reflecting that different learning attributes will have different impacts on a student's learning effectiveness. This new algorithm enables various learning support applications to become more practical and accurate in supporting student learning.

AB Quantitative methods in education research have long been limited by the ability to collect detailed learner data in a consistent, scalable way. As education continues to move online we are presented with an unprecedented opportunity to study learner interactions within learning systems. However, doing so requires infrastructure to collect and store massive interaction data from which we can learn. In this paper we present Data Depository, a flexible, pluggable, data hub for tracking interaction data from any browser-based application, aiding the measurement of usage and effectiveness.

AB Learning Analytics (LA) is increasingly used in Education to set prediction models from artificial intelligence to determine learning profiles. This study aims to determining to what extent K-nearest neighbor and random forest algorithms could become a useful tool for improving the teaching-learning process and reducing academic failure in two Physics courses at the Technological Institute of Monterrey, Mexico (n = 268). A quasi-experimental and mixed method approach was conducted. The main results showed significant differences between the first and second term evaluations in the two groups. One of the main findings of the study is that the predictions were not very accurate for each student in the first term evaluation. However, the predictions became more accurate as the algorithm was fed with larger datasets from the second term evaluation. This result indicates how predictive algorithms based on decision trees, can offer a close approximation to the academic performance that will occur in the class, and this information could be use along with the personal impressions coming from the teacher.

AB The real-time and granularized learning information and recommendations available from adaptive learning technology can provide learners with feedback that is personalized. However, at an individual level, learners often experience technological and pedagogical conflicts. Learners have more freedom to accept, ignore or reject the feedback while also having the challenges of building learning strategies and utilizing learning information that requires self-regulated learning skills. Given the conflicts, both understanding how learners learn and providing support for learners to be more self-regulated in the learning environment are imperative. This investigation explores how learners processed their learning in an adaptive technology-integrated learning analytics dashboard (ALAD). It employed mixed-methods using a lens of self-regulated learning (SRL). Three groups were identified based on clustering analysis of the learners' usage of warm-up (WU) tests. Sequence analysis revealed the time trends of each group's interactions with course content. Reflexive thematic analysis brought insights on how learners built their learning strategies (eg, ways of using WU tests and submodule assessments) and how they monitored and controlled their learning. It showed their dynamic interactions with core adaptive learning analytics dashboard elements. Challenges such as difficulties in rehearsing and monitoring through segmented course content arose from the new structural changes. We suggest the need of future improvement to individual learning support through the learning analytics dashboard to be more diverse and dynamic (real-time) over the course of learning while reducing potential undesirable consequences. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic One purpose of learning analytics and adaptive learning is to help learners identify learning goals and take action to achieve their goals. Learning analytics intervention showed support in learners' reflection phase SRL. However, it is not clear how to better support actionable and strategic changes to learning. Learning improvement through learning analytics interventions varies depending on how learners utilize feedback and monitor their learning progress, interacting with their digital learning environments. What this paper adds Learners established certain learning strategies with core adaptive learning analytics dashboard elements (eg, use of assessments, monitoring strategies). Learners' perceptions about learning support from the ALAD were built by interacting with the learners' task and cognitive conditions. Based on the perceptions, individuals' various SRL strategies and the need for diverse support were found. Monitoring and rehearsals can be challenging when course content is broken down for individuals' support. Implications for practice and/or policy Courses with adaptive learning analytics dashboards need to be designed more carefully, considering possible undesirable consequences, and to improve SRL support. Learners need more diverse learning support at an individual level based on how they interact with the learning environment.

AB The advancements in the education sector made e-learning more popular in recent years. The velocity of learning content creation and its availability is also growing exponentially day after day. It is challenging for a learner to find a learning path for a course with a vast content repository. So, recommending a learning path helps the learners streamline the learning materials systematically and achieve their goals. This article proposes a learning path recommendation approach focused on knowledge building and learning performance analysis. The model considers both static and dynamic learner parameters for learning path generation. The difficulty level of the learning resources is tuned based on the real-time performance analysis of the students. The learning resources are recommended based on learning preferences and the ability of a learner to learn the specific learning resource. The model also predicts the learning time and the expected score for each learner. Root Mean Square Deviation and Coefficient of Determination (R-Squared error) measures are used to find the correctness of the prediction. The model is also checked for its adaptivity to the learners' changing behavior and diversity of the LOs recommended for different learners. Ninety-six undergraduate learners participated in the study. The experimentations are conducted with 530 LOs from selected courses. The comparison results with three existing models show a better performance from the proposed approach with an average accuracy rise of 30% in learning path prediction based on the expected duration of learning 27.8% in expected score prediction with the second-best performing model. It is observed that the real-time learning analytics using the implicit learner log data benefits the recommendation process. LO rating strongly indicated the enhancement of learner satisfaction and experience with a rise of 25.5% when comparing the rating share with the second-best model.

DE Learning analytics; Fuzzy Logic; hybrid system
AB Learning analytics, being a very active field of research, recently has a number of significant contributions where data related to students' demographics, learning and behaviour is being used to predict student performance. In higher education institutes most of these models are based on statistical and machine learning techniques. The biggest challenge that can be seen in almost all these research efforts is the ineffective portability of prediction model across multiple cohorts even in the same institute. We propose to use hybrid fuzzy-statistical model for predicting student performance based on behaviour related predictors in a particular cohort. We have recently started this project so preliminary details of our model based on Fuzzy Expert System are provided. The model is proposed for enhancing traditional statistical models with Fuzzy Sets/Fuzzy Logic to overcome the limitations of commonly used statistical techniques and deliver a stronger system with combined advantages of both domains.

AB This paper presents the H2O Learn (Hybrid and Human-Oriented Learning) project, a coordinated research project funded by the Spanish Research Agency, which just started in 2021 and will last for three years. The main goal of the H2O Learn project is to build Trustworthy and Human-Centered Learning Analytics (TaHCLA) solutions to support human stakeholders when designing, orchestrating and (self-, socially- or co-) regulating learning in Hybrid Learning (HL). The contributions of H2O Learn consider key requirements for trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI), as defined by the European Commission: 1) fostering human (i.e., teachers, learners.) agency; 2) enabling transparency of the Learning Analytics (LA) systems; 3) seeking socio-emotional and inclusive wellbeing; and 4) promoting accountability by enabling the assessment of algorithms and design processes.

TI Learning Analytics at "Small" Scale: Exploring a Complexity-Grounded
   Model for Assessment Automation

AB This study proposes a process-oriented, automatic, formative assessment model for small group learning based on complex systems theory using a small dataset from a technology-mediated, synchronous mathematics learning environment. We first conceptualize small group learning as a complex system and explain how group dynamics and interaction can be modeled via theoretically grounded, simple rules. These rules are then operationalized to build temporally-embodied measures, where varying weights are assigned to the same measures according to their significance during different time stages based on the golden ratio concept. This theory-based measure construction method in combination with a correlation-based feature subset selection algorithm reduces data dimensionality, making a complex system more understandable for people. Further, because the discipline of education often generates small datasets, a Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes classifier was coded to develop an assessment model, which achieves the highest accuracy (95.8%) as compared to baseline models. Finally, we describe a web-based tool that visualizes time-series activities, assesses small group learning automatically, and also offers actionable intelligence for teachers to provide real-time support and intervention to students. The fundamental contribution of this paper is that it makes complex, small group behavior visible to teachers in a learning context quickly. Theoretical and methodological implications for technology mediated small group learning and learning analytics as a whole are then discussed.

AB Learning analytics promise significant benefit to online education providers through improved, better-targeted student services. Much has been written about the potential of analytics and how they might be technically implemented, and various ethical considerations are published highlighting the significant potential risk of gathering, manipulating and applying student data to education. Developing an ethical position provides institutions with an opportunity to critically appraise their assumptions and practice however how best to articulate one is far from clear. This case study outlines the development of an ethical framework at Open Polytechnic of New Zealand and demonstrates how international ethics guidelines for learning analytics have shaped practice and informed policy development. Four stages to developing an ethics position in education institutions were followed: 1) examining existing institutional policy, 2) categorising student data, 3) addressing ethics concerns in a structured way and 4) approving an ethics position and extending practice. The paper concludes with suggestions for those developing ethics positions for implementing learning analytics to help towards a successful outcome.

AB Emerge of new technologies such as mobile devices, social media, gamification and learning analytics using big data have opened up solutions to meet the increased demand of personalized learning in the 21st century European classroom (Fizgerald et al., 2013). Yet many challenges remain, particularly in topics of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)(Bybee, 2010). Students are unmotivated to head for STEM careers where professionals are increasingly needed (Harackiewicz et al., 2012). Future learning environments should be able to support personalized, tailored solutions for all students (Santos et al., 2014). Costs and risks of early school leavers are a global societal challenge, in which the emerge of new learning technologies, could have a direct impact upon. Technology-supported PLEs have been developed over the last few decades to increase students' motivation and support individual learning paths suitable for each student's learning styles (Felder & Spurlin, 2005) and preferences. Fast developing technologies propose a challenge also for teachers who lack both the time and the competences (Clements & Pawlowski, 2012) to make use of these technologies.
   In this research we first investigated the PLE state-of-the-art through literature review. We then tackled the question of what should the future's personal learning environments for STEM be like. Through a pre-commercial procurement (PCP) method we prepared PCP based on the literature review, as well as invitation to tender for which 11 complete PLE service offers were received. Those offers were then the evaluated and analyzed for the technical and pedagogical functionalities with a panel of teachers from four countries in Europe (Finland, Sweden, Germany and Spain) as well as three specifically chosen external experts (technical, pedagogical and STEM). 65-point criteria rising from the literature review was used for this.
   The analysis of the evaluation panel show that the state-of-the-art in PLEs is still far behind of more commercial fields such as retail industry or social media solutions. Smart use of learning analytics can solve many of these challenges. Users expect the system to read their minds and guide them to the support they need, whether it is learning style tailored content, or smart solutions for peer support within their own classrooms. Teachers should be able to evaluate entire classrooms of students within one dashboard. The current state-of-the-art in PLEs unfortunately uses very little of the possibilities learning analytics could provide: Often the systems tend to only measure user behavior instead of actual learning.
   Our findings also show that users should be involved early into the PLE design process and testing should be conducted in real classrooms. Overall the dialogue between demand and supply side throughout the development is the key to the PCP's success. The contribution of this study is a trend guideline for PLE stakeholders, which could be specifically be used in designing improved learning solutions. This work has been conducted in within European Union co-funded IMAILE project.

AB Student-facing learning analytics (SFLA) hold promise for supporting the development of self-regulated learning (SRL) skills students need for academic success, especially in online learning. However, the promise of SFLA for supporting SRL is unrealized because current SFLA design methods are technocentric, with little attention to learning science theory and student needs, and there is little guidance for SFLA designers. Based on insights from literature and a survey with learning analytics (LA) experts, we have developed a framework to guide the design of SFLA. The framework is built around three questions that designers should address to generate SFLA features for supporting SRL: What are the students' self-regulated learning support needs based on self-regulated learning theory? What are the students' perspectives of SFLA in meeting their SRL needs? What SFLA features are appropriate to support students' self-regulated learning based on their SRL needs? A set of activities that should be conducted to respond to each question is identified within the framework. To evaluate the framework, a focus group discussion with LA experts was conducted, and feedback obtained was used to revise the framework. The framework provides a rationale for understanding student needs as informed by theory.

AB Digitalization catalyzes drastic changes to a particular subject or area. Digitalization is an operational structure transformation process, such as in the educational domain. Digitalization in the academic field has brought the classroom to the users' fingertips with the prevalence of elearning applications, learning management systems, etc. However, with the increasing number of digital learning platform users, educators find it hard to monitor their students' progress. Analytics that analyze data generated from the usage pattern of the users contribute to giving the educators an insight regarding the performance of their students. With that, they can apply early intervention and modification of their delivery method to suit the students' needs and, at the same time, increase the quality of the content. This study illustrates the development of a learning analytics dashboard that can improve learning outcomes for educators and students.

AB To perform successfully in higher education learners are considered to engage in self-regulation. Prompts in digital learning environments aim at activating self-regulation strategies that learners know but do not spontaneously show. To investigate such interventions learning analytics approaches can be applied. This quasi experimental study (N = 110) investigates whether different prompts based on theory of self-regulated learning (e.g., cognitive, metacognitive, motivational) impact declarative knowledge and transfer, perceptions as well as online learning behavior, and whether trace data can inform learning performance. Findings indicate small effects of prompts supporting the performance in a declarative knowledge and transfer test. In addition, the prompted groups showed different online learning behavior than the control group. However, trace data in this study were not capable of sufficiently explaining learning performance in a transfer test. Future research is required to investigate adaptive prompts using trace data in authentic learning settings as well as focusing on learners? reactions to distinct prompts.

DE Learning Managing Systems; 2.0 tools; Analytical Chemistry; 2.0
   Education
AB New technologies can organize learning activities that make it possible to acquire several abilities in order to prepare students for their future professional activities. All this is possible when learning managing system (LMS) platforms are used as activities containers. Moodle platforms present versatility and comprise different aspects such as user administration, the incorporation of training activities, access control, learning monitoring and student assessment. This platform includes 2.0 tools such as wikis, blogs, multimedia tools, applets, freeware software, questionnaires (Hot Potatoes) and on-line tutoring.
   In this paper, 2.0 education is presented as a form of better communication with students, intensifying the transmission of concepts using technologies that students are familiar with (smartphones, iPads, tablet computers, etc.), where they can stay up-to-date via a simple search on their mobile devices. These tools help to make certain that they are ready for laboratory activities by giving them the so-called "pre-lab questionnaire" before each laboratory session, a learning activity itself because it includes a feedback process to reinforce controlled on-line self-learning. Furthermore, 2.0 education contributes to the acquisition of different abilities such as problem-solving, teamwork, critical thinking, and so forth.
   This learning methodology was used for half a year in the subject "Analytical Chemistry I" at the University of Granada as part of the new chemistry degree with good results. 2.0 education offers the educational community a new way to complement the process of learning concepts that were once difficult to master.

AB Background In the field of Learning Design, it is common that researchers analyse manually design artefacts created by practitioners, using pedagogically-grounded approaches (e.g., Bloom's Taxonomy), both to understand and later to support practitioners' design practices. Automatizing these high-level pedagogically-grounded analyses would enable large-scale studies on practitioners' design practices. Such an approach would be especially useful in the context of mobile learning, where practitioners' design practices are under-explored and complex (e.g., involving both formal and informal learning activities, happening between physical and digital spaces). Objectives We inquire about the kind of designs that practitioners create in mobile learning by analysing the entire databases of two m-learning tools, Avastusrada and Smartzoos, which promote inquiry learning outdoors. Methods We use supervised machine learning to classify the textual content of the designs based on the cognitive level required from learners, the inquiry-based learning phases they cover, and their connection with the learning context (e.g., the role played by the situated environment). Results and Conclusions Results from the in-the-wild studies emphasize practitioners' tendency to design contextualized activities, but that include few higher-order thinking tasks and elements of inquiry learning. This raises questions about the real-life pedagogical value of similar mobile learning tools and highlights the need for providing pedagogical guidelines and technical solutions that would promote the adoption of good learning design practices. Major takeaways from the study While we show that machine learning techniques (informed by learning design elements) can enable large-scale studies and provide useful insights, to best understand and support practitioners' design practices it would be necessary to combine them with other quantitative and quantitative analyses (e.g., a qualitative understanding on why practitioners take specific design decisions). Future research could use similar machine learning approaches to explore other design settings, as well as explore scenarios where similar algorithms can be embedded in design tools, to guide practitioners' design practices.

AB This paper introduces a learning analytics policy development framework developed by a cross-European research project team - SHEILA (Supporting Higher Education to Integrate Learning Analytics), based on interviews with 78 senior managers from 51 European higher education institutions across 16 countries. The framework was developed using the RAPID Outcome Mapping Approach (ROMA), which is designed to develop effective strategies and evidence-based policy in complex environments. This paper presents three case studies to illustrate the development process of the SHEILA policy framework, which can be used to inform strategic planning and policy processes in real world environments, particularly for large-scale implementation in higher education contexts.

AB Nowadays, schools use many information systems to automate their activities for different stakeholders' groups - learning management systems, student diary, library systems, digital repositories, financial management and accounting systems, document processing systems, etc. The huge amount of data generated by the users of these systems, led to increased interest in the collection and analysis of data to encourage students to achieve higher results, teachers to provide personalized support and school managers to make data-driven decisions at all levels of school, and stimulates research into the application of Learning Analytics (LA) in schools. The paper presents a LA model and a software prototype of the LA tool designed for the needs of Bulgarian school education from the perspective of different stakeholder groups (students, teachers, class teachers, parents, school managers, inspectors from evaluation agencies), aiming to improve school methods of approaching and analyzing learning data. The tool allows stakeholders to track data for students' learning or training for different purposes, e.g. monitoring, analysis, forecast, intervention, recommendations, etc., but finally to improve the quality of learning and teaching processes. Research and experiments with the model and the LA tool under consideration are conducted based on the information infrastructure of a typical Bulgarian school.

AB During recent years the field of Learning Analytics have been frequently mentioned in discussions of addressing challenges in education, as well as a means to analyse and draw upon students' strengths in educational contexts. Prognoses for the future labour market show an increasing need of programmers, yet studies show that programming education struggle with student dropout, poor academic performance and low pass rates. The aim of this study was to analyse and discuss potential obstacles and opportunities in using learning analytics tools for forecasting student success in relation to course outcomes in programming education.
   This study was carried out as a literature review with a theorical framework for Learning Analytics presented by Yassine, Kadry and Sicilia (2016) in "A framework for learning analytics in moodle for assessing course outcomes". In 2016 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON) (pp. 261-266). IEEE." as the basis for a content analysis with deductive coding. Main keywords in the literature search was: learning analytics, programming, education, course, tool, obstacles, opportunities. Keywords were combined with the Boolean operators "and" and "or". The literature search was limited to recently published research (between years 2015 and 2019).
   The study shows that learning analytics tools, if thoughtfully used, is an opportunity to forecast student success and improve educational design, both from the student perspective and from the teacher perspective. Learning analytics tools does not necessarily have to build on quantitative big data analyses only. From a teacher perspective it could be more valuable with a mixed method approach in the strive to improve existing course design. As pointed out in several research studies students' and teachers' integrity have to be respected. Today's virtual learning environments provide huge amounts of learning data, but as in all other types of research, this should build on informed consent. Finally, in a new approach of learning analytics the analyses preferably should include some teaching analytics as well, to better improve course design and learning outcomes.

AB The development of skills in the engineering education is one of the issues that generate greater interest at present. Thanks to Learning Analytics, we found an excellent opportunity to offer a quality competence assessment of our engineering students. Research in Learning Analytics currently focuses on applying these techniques to find out how the student learns and to improve teaching/learning processes. A key aspect in improving these processes is the assessment of general competences, which constitutes key learning in engineering students and has thus been identified as a need that can be met by Learning Analytics. This article presents two related studies conducted at the University of Deusto. The first study wants to show that it is possible to carry out an assessment of the project management competence through the analysis of the data that is obtained when the students interact with certain tools for the management of projects. In this sense, in the first study conducted with 93 students in the academic year 2014-2015, it compares the automatic assessment performed with Learning Analytics and the manual assessment carried out by the teacher. Another objective of this first study is to compare the validity at the time to assess the project management competence of the three technological tools used in the study. In the second study conducted with 227 students in the academic year 2015-2016, an assessment model is designed based on analytical data that is extracted from even more complex technological tools. In this second study the objective is to demonstrate that the use of Learning Analytics assessment to carry out continuous monitoring and provide feedback to the students, directly influences their capacity to manage a project and therefore, leads to an improvement in their results. The model designed in both studies for analysis is described in this paper, in addition to the methodology and research carried out.

ID ANALYTICS
AB The unprecedented context of uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 disease stresses the educational system of secondary education. Isolation and social distancing forced the change from face to face education to remote emergency training to guarantee pedagogical continuity. Faced with this change in modality, learning analytics as a research method of techno-pedagogical d-learning models allow evaluating its effects on the development of meaningful learning. The present investigation was carried out in a group of 69 students with an average age of 16.06 years. The techno-pedagogical model was based on the use of the applications of the collaboration tools of Google Suit for Education. The contents were developed for the teaching of Newton's Laws of Motion from an interdisciplinary approach (Physics and Physical Education) based on the Science, Technology and Society perspective. The data collection of the learning process was carried out over a period of three months. For its analysis, four categories of analytics were applied: the instructional context, the motivation, the content and the discourse. The results identify the development of metacognitive skills: meta-learning and meta-knowledge. From the discussion, the idea of a meaningful learning analytics that allows transforming information and communication technologies into learning technologies and metacognitive knowledge is arrived at.

AB Social media sites are increasingly being adopted to support teaching practice in higher education. Learning Analytics (LA) dashboards can be used to reveal how students engage with course material and others in the class. However, research on the best practices of designing, developing, and evaluating such dashboards to support teaching and learning with social media has been limited. Considering the increasing use of Twitter for both formal and informal learning processes, this paper presents our design process and a LA prototype dashboard developed based on a comprehensive literature review and an online survey among 54 higher education instructors who have used Twitter in their teaching.

AB This paper focuses on a design based research study about STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) learning by making through collaboration and production. This study examines learning by making by students to explore STEM using a constructionist approach with a particular focus on computer science and engineering. The use of IoT as a technology enhanced learning (TEL) tool created the learning conditions to be studied: (a) collaborative: no one person had the knowledge to complete the project alone, (b) problem-based: no off the shelf solution was used, and (c) multidisciplinary: the learning context pushed the boundaries across the subjects. The study investigated the learning conditions and indicators of collaboration and production taking place when learning about STEM. The results were used to inform the design of effective data analytics and visualization tools for the PELARS project to advance practice-based learning activities in STEM teaching. However, more specifically, the findings provide insight into the knowledge construction process when learning through making in complex environments. These insights illustrate the combined pedagogical value of collaboration and production supporting the multidisciplinary learning opportunities. The importance of community knowledge construction and its relationship to the pedagogical approach is examined. The significance of these findings in the context of IoT TEL tools in education is explored.

AB The application of student interaction data is a promising field for blended learning (BL), which combines conventional face-to-face and online learning activities. However, the application of online learning technologies in BL settings is particularly challenging for students with lower self-regulatory abilities. In this study, a personalized learning analytics (LA) intervention approach that incorporates ebook and recommendation systems is proposed. The proposed approach provides students with actionable feedback regarding personalized remedial actions as the intervention to help them to strategically engage in the use of the ebook system and avoid academic failure when engaged in BL. A quasi-experiment was conducted to examine two classes of an undergraduate course that implemented a conventional BL model. The experimental group comprised 45 students from one class who learned using the proposed approach and received personalized intervention, whereas the control group comprised 42 students from the other class who learned using the conventional BL approach without receiving personalized intervention. The experimental results indicated that the proposed approach can improve students' learning achievements and behavioral engagement in BL. The findings provide pedagogical insights into the application of LA intervention with actionable feedback in BL environments.

AB Learning is a marked change in the conceptual representation of the world, in naturally intelligent entities, such as humans, as well as in artificially intelligent entities. Analytics aims at the generation of situational awareness, specifically, moments of insight that effect such a marked change and the enablers of the change. In that, Learning Analytics is the study of detection, analysis, and generation of moments of insights about learning experiences of naturally or artificially intelligent entities. It enriches learning experiences as a measurable consequence of these moments of insights. In infusing authenticity to learning experiences, this chapter discusses abstraction-oriented pedagogy at one end of a continuum and reality-oriented pedagogy at the other end and offers a characterization of this continuum.

AB Learners are expected to stay wakeful and focused while interacting with e-learning platforms. Although wakefulness of learners strongly relates to educational outcomes, detecting drowsy learning behaviors only from log data is not an easy task. In this study, we describe the results of our research to model learners' wakefulness based on multimodal data generated from heart rate, seat pressure, and face recognition. We collected multimodal data from learners in a blended course of informatics and conducted two types of analysis on them. First, we clustered features based on learners' wakefulness labels as generated by human raters and ran a statistical analysis. This analysis helped us generate insights from multimodal data that can be used to inform learner and teacher feedback in multimodal learning analytics. Second, we trained machine learning models with multiclass-Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and CatBoost Classifier (CatBoost) algorithms to recognize learners' wakefulness states automatically. We achieved an average macro-F1 score of 0.82 in automated user-dependent models with CatBoost. We also showed that compared to unimodal data from each sensor, the multimodal sensor data can improve the accuracy of models predicting the wakefulness states of learners while they are interacting with e-learning platforms.

ID ANALYTICS
AB Research on instructional and learning design is 'booming' in Europe, although there has been a move from a focus on content and the way to present it in a formal educational context (i.e., instruction), to a focus on complex learning, learning environments including the workplace, and access to learner data available in these environments. We even see the term 'learning experience design' (Neelen and Kirschner 2020) to describe the field. Furthermore, there is an effort to empower teachers (and even students) as designers of learning (including environments and new pedagogies), and to support their reflection on their own practice as part of their professional development (Hansen and Wasson 2016; Luckin et al. 2016; Wasson et al. 2016). While instructional design is an often heard term in the United States and refers to "translating principles of learning and instruction into plans for instructional materials, activities, information resources, and evaluation" (Smith and Ragan 1999), Europe tends to lean more towards learning design as the key for providing efficient, effective, and enjoyable learning experiences. This is not a switch from an instructivist to a constructivist view nor from a teacher-centred to a student-centred paradigm. It is, rather, a different mind-set where the emphasis is on the goal (i.e., learning) rather than the approach (i.e., instruction). Designing learning opportunities in a technology enhanced world builds on theories of human learning and cognition, opportunities provided by technology, and principles of instructional design. New technology both expands and challenges some instructional design principles by opening up new opportunities for distance collaboration, intelligent tutoring and support, seamless and ubiquitous learning and assessment technologies, and tools for thinking and thought. In this article, the authors give an account of their own and other research related to instructional and learning design, highlight related European research, and point to future research directions.

AB In this work, 29 features were defined and implemented to be automatically extracted and analysed in the context of NeuroK, a learning platform within the neurodidactics paradigm. Neurodidactics is an educational paradigm that addresses optimization of the learning and teaching process from the perspective of how the brain functions. In this context, the features extracted can be fed as input into various machine learning algorithms to predict the students' performance. The proposed approach was tested with data from an international course with 698 students. Accuracies greater than 0.99 were obtained in predicting the students' final performance. The best model was achieved with the Random Forest algorithm. It selected 7 relevant features, all with a clear interpretation in the learning process. These features are related to the principles of neurodidactics, and reflect the importance of a social learning and constructivist approach in this context. This work constitutes a first step in relating the tools of learning analytics to neurodidactics. The method, after its adaptation to capture relevant features corresponding to different contexts, could be implemented on other management learning platforms, and applied to other online courses with the aim of predicting the students' performance, including real-time tracking of their progress and risk of dropout.

AB E-Learning systems have caused a rapid increase to the amount of learning content available on the web. It has become a time consuming and a daunting task for e-learners to find the relevant content that they should study. Existing e-learning technology lacks the automated capability to provide guidance for students to prioritize and engage in the most vital course content. The students who are unable to find out the most suitable resources, for their studies and the assignments, may waste most of their time on browsing and searching. Some of the "good-students" can indirectly act as good guides to other students. Average learners could follow the content adopted by good students in the process of learning. It is possible to capture the behaviour of "good-students" and expose it as a form of automated guiding. For this to work it is important to be able to predict students who are going to be successful at the end of the course based on their performance during the early part of the course. This work demonstrates the use of data mining techniques on e-Learning data to enable "Good-students" to indirectly guide "Average-Students" to find the most relevant content on an e-Learning environment.

AB Learning analytics has become a buzzword, in practice often accompanied by comprehensive use of digital technologies. This study takes a qualitative approach by analysing performance data within the bounds of one module. High failure rates prompted an action research study to check for performance patterns as seen at the exam. Generally, students were successful at conducting calculations, but struggling when being asked conceptual and theoretical questions. Further analysis demonstrated a lack of alignment between tasks posed in exercises and at the exam. Particularly in the second half of the course, students claimed they were asked theoretical and conceptual questions that had not been previously addressed in the exercises. The project set out to align conceptual and algorithmic tasks as featured in the various parts of the curriculum. Furthermore, a theoretical mid-term test was introduced to focus exclusively on conceptual issues, some of which were re-addressed at the final exam. Due to the interventions, failure rates were greatly reduced and with students' feedback generally supportive.

AB We are still designing educational experiences for the average student, and have room to improve. Learning analytics provides a way forward. This commentary describes how learning analytics-based applications are well positioned to meaningfully personalize the learning experience in diverse ways. In so doing, learning analytics has the potential to contribute to more equitable and socially just educational outcomes for students who might otherwise be seen through the lens of the average student. Utilizing big data, good design, and the input of the stakeholders, learning analytics techniques aim to develop applications for the sole purpose of reducing the classroom size to 1. Over time, these digital innovations will enable us to do away with a model of education that teaches toward the non-existent average student, replacing it with one that is more socially just-one that addresses the individual needs of every student.

AB Currently, the rapid development of modern technologies has been influencing and changing every aspect of our society, in an attempt to make our lives more convenient and intelligent. Constructing and applying Smart Learning Environments (SLEs) is such an effort to offer learners personalised learning experiences both effectively and efficiently. In the past half century, a steady development in the literature on SLEs has been identified. Moreover, most studies have been conducted in the fields of computer science, engineering, mathematics and social science. In the meantime, several technological components of SLEs have been identified as follows: overall, dynamic and open models of learners, mobile technologies and innovative technologies, intelligent cloud service, educational big data and learning analytics. Some salient pedagogical affordances of SLEs have also been presented, such as personalised learning content and paths, cognitive guiding, developing high-order abilities, facilitating diverse learning modes, and fostering autonomous learning and lifelong learning abilities. Finally, several future developmental trends or suggestions are proposed, such as taking learners' self-assessments into consideration when making decisions on personalised guiding, investigating the implementation of strategies and the application effects of the mixed learning modes based on SLEs in different teaching contexts, and so on.

AB As instruction shifts away from traditional approaches, online learning has grown in popularity in K-12 and higher education. Artificial intelligence (AI) and learning analytics methods such as machine learning have been used by educational scholars to support online learners on a large scale. However, the fairness of AI prediction in educational contexts has received insufficient attention, which can increase educational inequality. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a fair logistic regression (Fair-LR) algorithm. Specifically, we developed Fair-LR and compared it with fairness-unaware AI models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest). We evaluated fairness with equalized odds that caters to statistical type I and II errors in predictions across demographic subgroups. The results showed that the Fair-LR could generate desirable predictive accuracy while achieving better fairness. The findings implied that the educational community could adopt a methodological shift to achieve accurate and fair AI to support learning and reduce bias.

AB Computational thinking (CT) is becoming a growing field in educational research and practice. CT is not only related to coding or programming, but also a fundamental skill for everyone to solve problems effectively and efficiently with solutions that are reusable in different contexts, which helps to improve our analytical ability for different tasks. Therefore, parents are eager to enroll their children in children programming courses. This paper presents the design of a web-based game for learning computational thinking anywhere and anytime. It has a visual programming environment for programming virtual robot to complete specific tasks. Our game levels are designed to cover the following five core elements of CT: reformulation, recursion, decomposition, abstraction and systematic testing. The game also supports collaborative learning, in which some game levels involve multiple robots to be programmed by multiple players at the same time. A survey on twenty undergraduate computer science students showed that our game requires the application of the above five core elements of CT to complete, and is likely to be an attractive learning tool for learners including primary students.

AB Affective state recognition has recently attracted a notable amount of attention in the research community, as it can be directly linked to a student's performance during learning. Consequently, being able to retrieve the affect of a student can lead to more personalized education, targeting higher degrees of engagement and, thus, optimizing the learning experience and its outcomes. In this paper, we apply Machine Learning (ML) and present a novel approach for affect recognition in Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) by understanding learners' experience through tracking their interactions with a serious game as a learning platform. We utilize a variety of interaction parameters to examine their potential to be used as an indicator of the learner's affective state. Driven by the Theory of Flow model, we investigate the correspondence between the prediction of users' self -reported affective states and the interaction features. Cross -subject evaluation using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on a dataset of 32 participants interacting with the platform demonstrated that the proposed framework could achieve a significant precision in affect recognition. The subject -based evaluation highlighted the benefits of an adaptive personalized learning experience, contributing to achieving optimized levels of engagement.

AB Although temporality is embodied in instructional design, implicitly present in several learning theories and central to the self-regulation of learning and awarding of credits, it has not received the due attention in the field education. This learning analytics study included four higher education courses in dental education over a full year duration. Temporality in terms of when students engage in learning was studied on daily, weekly, course, and year basis. The patterns of low and high achiever groups in each period were visually plotted and compared. Correlation with the performance was evaluated using the non-parametric Spearman correlation test using re-sampling permutation technique.
   The findings of this study highlight some important points; temporality is a defining factor of how students regulate their learning and should be taken into account when designing a possible monitoring system. High achievers were always active early in the year, in the course, and on assignments. Low achievers, on the other hand, tend to be significantly more active close to examination times. Using only temporality predictors, we were able to predict high achievers with 100% precision and low achievers with 82.3% to 93.3% class precision. Since early participation was the predictor, it means that an early alert indicator can be achieved that enables timely intervention.

AB With the average shelf life of an employee's skills at less than five years, it is imperative that organizations support their employees in staying current in new and emerging skills and in learning how to learn. Learning management systems, once seen as a one-size-fits all learning solution, have not effectively kept pace with wider technology development, and the needs and expectations of workplace learning. Moreover, organizations tend to have too narrow a view when considering the elements that affect learning at their organization. An ecological and holistic approach is needed to improve learning environments and to future-proof these environments for new developments in education and technology. This paper explores the existing literature and frameworks for learning ecosystems and proposes a new learning ecosystem framework that consists of seven key elements: (1) technology and data architecture, (2) governance, (3) analytics, (4) semantic ePortfolios, (5) intrinsic and extrinsic motivators, (6) social learning and engagement, and (7) personalization.

AB Educational games aim to balance learning and playing. However, for people to benefit from an educational game, they must be encouraged to play the game often. Providing players with information about how to improve their performance could help in achieving this goal. This paper examines how a learning analytics dashboard can be incorporated into an educational game to encourage players to play more often and continuously. The proposed dashboard provides players with a variety of information such as how their performance and skills change over time. Such information allows players to see their performance and play habits, and find strategies on how to improve their performance, and therefore their learning, in the game.

AB Blended learning combines online digital resources with traditional classroom activities and enables students to attain higher learning performance through well-defined interactive strategies involving online and traditional learning activities. Learning analytics is a conceptual framework and as a part of our Precision education used to analyze and predict students' performance and provide timely interventions based on student learning profiles. This study applied learning analytics and educational big data approaches for the early prediction of students' final academic performance in a blended Calculus course. Real data with 21 variables were collected from the proposed course, consisting of video-viewing behaviors, out-of-class practice behaviors, homework and quiz scores, and after-school tutoring. This study applied principal component regression to predict students' final academic performance. The experimental results show that students' final academic performance could be predicted when only one-third of the semester had elapsed. In addition, we identified seven critical factors that affect students' academic performance, consisting of four online factors and three traditional factors. The results showed that the blended data set combining online and traditional critical factors had the highest predictive performance.

AB In recent years, learning analytics has been attracting attention. Learning analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments. Generally, its information are stored in Learning Management System (LMS) and Course Management System (CMS). However, LMS and CMS did not have the method to measure the achievement of learning using lecture contents. This paper proposes the methods to measure the achievement of learning using lecture contents.

AB Big data analytics has shown tremendous success in several fields such as businesses, agriculture, health, and meteorology, and education is no exception. Concerning its role in education, it is used to boost students' learning process by predicting their performance in advance and adapting the relevant instructional design strategies. This study primarily intends to develop a system that can predict students' performance and help teachers to timely introduce corrective interventions to uplift the performance of low-performing students. As a secondary part of this research, it also explores the potential of collaborative learning as an intervention to act in combination with the prediction system to improve the performance of students. To support such changes, a visualization system is also developed to track and monitor the performance of students, groups, and overall class to help teachers in the regrouping of students concerning their performance. Several well-known machine learning models are applied to predict students performance. Results suggest that experimental groups performed better after treatment than before treatment. The students who took part in each class activity, prepared and submitted their tasks perform much better than other students. Overall, the study found that collaborative learning methods play a significant role to enhance the learning capability of the students.

AB Learning analytics is a technology that employs paternalistic nudging techniques and predictive measures. These techniques can limit student autonomy, may run counter to student interests and preferences, and do not always distribute benefits back to students-in fact some harms may actually accrue. The paper presents three cases of paternalism in learning analytics technologies, arguing that paternalism is an especially problematic concern for higher education institutions who espouse liberal education values. Three general recommendations are provided that work to promote student autonomy and choice making as a way to protect against risks to student academic freedom.

AB Higher education institutions are challenged to develop innovative educational solutions to meet the competence development requirements set by the emerging future. This qualitative case study aims to identify the future competences considered important for higher education students to acquire during their studies and how the development of these competences can be supported with learning analytics. Reflection on these issues is based on three dimensions (subject development, object, and social environment) of future competences. A special emphasis is placed on the views of 19 teaching professionals gathered from group interviews and analyzed through a qualitative content analysis. The findings indicate that subject development-related future competences, such as reflective competence, self-awareness and self-management, learning literacy, and personal agency and self-efficacy were strongly identified as necessary future competences. The potential of learning analytics to support their development was also widely recognized as it provides means to reflect on learning and competence development and increase one's self-awareness of strengths and weaknesses. In addition, learning analytics was considered to promote goal-orientation, metacognition and learning to learn, active engagement as well as learning confidence. To deal with complex topics and tasks, students should also acquire object-related competences, such as changeability and digital competence. In addition, they need cooperation and communication competence as well as a developmental mindset to operate successfully in social environments. The use of learning analytics to support most of these object and social environment-related competences was considered promising as it enables the wide exploitation of digital tools and systems, the analysis and visualization of social interactions, and the formation of purposeful learning groups and communal development practices. However, concrete ways of applying learning analytics were largely unacknowledged. This study provides useful insights on the relationship of important future competences and learning analytics while expanding on previous research and conceptual modelling. The findings support professionals working at higher education institutions in facilitating successful conditions for the development of future competences and in advancing purposeful use of learning analytics.

AB Background: Although blended learning (BL) has multiple educational prospects, it also poses challenges such as keeping students motivated.
   Objectives: This study investigates students' perceptions of how learning analytics (LA) can be used to support the design of a BL environment in order to promote students' basic need for relatedness, which is a dimension of motivation. Hence, it is hypothesized that sharing LA trends with students and illustrating which course adaptations were performed based on these trends, will result in positive student perceptions and can support students' basic need satisfaction for relatedness.
   Methods: A quasi-experimental intervention study was executed using a mixed-method approach (N = 257 students) in a BL course in university-based teacher education. The intervention focuses on three types of learning management system LA data (general, content, and background) that are actively used by the instructor. General data consists of generated time on task, content data deals with the content of a learning path and background data includes information about students' previous education.
   Results and Conclusions: The results show that students' perceptions regarding these LA are positive and most in favour of content data. Moreover, the qualitative data illustrate that students acknowledge the potential value of LA for stimulating relatedness.

AB The growing popularity of Social Networking Sites (SNS) that are embedded with networked infrastructures serves as an ideal platform for developing a networked learning environment connecting geographically dispersed learners. Unlike the traditional learning systems which provide only limited sources of data, the learners engaged in virtual networked social environments tend to produce huge volumes of digital footprints that cannot be analyzed using conventional analytical techniques. Two new branches of analytical sciences - Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics (LA) - are being employed for processing digital data derived from online educational platforms in order to obtain meaningful inferences and data-driven insights. Hence, the present experimental study involving a small group of geographically dispersed learners intend to examine the engagement level and interaction patterns that occur within a feminist networked learning environment created in Facebook using popular EDM and learning analytical techniques such as K-means Clustering, Social network analysis and correlation mining. Upon analysis, it was found that the peer network influence played a vital role in activating passive learners, eventually leading to the development of a closely bound networked learning community over time.

AB Twitter is a very popular microblogging platform that has been actively used by scientific communities to exchange scientific information and to promote scholarly discussions. The present study aimed to leverage the tweet data to provide valuable insights into the development of the learning analytics field since its initial days. Descriptive analysis, geocoding analysis, and topic modeling were performed on over 1.6 million tweets related to learning analytics posted between 2010-2021. The descriptive analysis reveals an increasing popularity of the field on the Twittersphere in terms of number of users, twitter posts, and hashtags emergence. The topic modeling analysis uncovers new insights of the major topics in the field of learning analytics. Emergent themes in the field were identified, and the increasing (e.g., Artificial Intelligence) and decreasing (e.g., Education) trends were shared. Finally, the geocoding analysis indicates an increasing participation in the field from more diverse countries all around the world. Further findings are discussed in the paper.

   Learning analytics framework
AB Many analytic tools have been developed to discover knowledge from student data. However, the knowledge discovery process requires advanced analytical modelling skills, making it the province of data scientists. This impedes the ability of educational leaders, professors, and advisors to engage with the knowledge discovery process directly. As a result, it is challenging for analysis to take advantage of domain expertise, making its outcome often neither interesting nor useful. Usually the outcome produced from such analytic tools is static, preventing domain experts from exploring different hypotheses by changing data models or predictive models inside the tool. We have developed a framework for interactive and exploratory learning analytics which begins to address these challenges. We engaged in data exploration and hypotheses generation with our university domain experts by conducting two focus groups. We used the findings of these focus groups to validate our framework, arguing that it enables domain experts to explore the data, analysis and interpretation of student data to discover useful and interesting knowledge.

AB Recently, learning analytics have played a vital role in predicting and monitoring students' performance. Our work-in-progress paper suggests, this data could be further analysed to ascertain the alignment between institutional strategic goals and staff performance approaches in higher education institutions. We extend this model to institutional performance based on key performance indicators. We contend that learning analytics could act as a crucial mechanism in achieving goal congruence between higher education institutions' strategy and performance and not limited to the study of students' performance. This study is aimed at finding how this could be applied to institutional level goal alignment.

AB The current pandemic has significantly impacted educational practices, modifying many aspects of how and when we learn. In particular, remote learning and the use of digital platforms have greatly increased in importance. Online teaching and e-learning provide many benefits for information retention and schedule flexibility in our on-demand world while breaking down barriers caused by geographic location, physical facilities, transportation issues, or physical impediments. However, educators and researchers have noticed that students face a learning and performance decline as a result of this sudden shift to online teaching and e-learning from classrooms around the world. In this paper, we focus on reviewing eye-tracking techniques and systems, data collection and management methods, datasets, and multi-modal learning data analytics for promoting pervasive and proactive learning in educational environments. We then describe and discuss the crucial challenges and open issues of current learning environments and data learning methods. The review and discussion show the potential of transforming traditional ways of teaching and learning in the classroom, and the feasibility of adaptively driving learning processes using eye-tracking, data science, multimodal learning analytics, and artificial intelligence. These findings call for further attention and research on collaborative and intelligent learning systems, plug-and-play devices and software modules, data science, and learning analytics methods for promoting the evolution of face-to-face learning and e-learning environments and enhancing student collaboration, engagement, and success.

DE Self-regulated learning; learning analytics; academic achievement;
   cluster analysis
AB Learning analytics can be used in conjunction with learner dispositions to identify at-risk students and provide personalized guidance on how to improve. Participants in the current study were students (n=192) studying a first year anatomy and physiology course. A two-step cluster analysis was performed using learning analytics data from the learning management system and self-regulated learning behavior from meta-learning assessment tasks. Three clusters of students were identified high, medium and low self-regulated learners. High self-regulated learners were engaged with the meta learning tasks, reported the most self-regulated learning strategies and used new strategies during semester. They also had the highest academic achievement. Compared to low self-regulated leaners, medium self-regulated learners were more engaged in the meta-learning tasks and used more learning strategies during semester, including new strategies; however, both medium and low self-regulated learners had similar levels of academic achievement. It is possible that the medium self-regulated learners represent students who were attempting to improve their learning, but had not yet found strategies that were right for them. Future evaluation of academic performance may determine whether the attempts to improve learning by medium self-regulated learners distinguishes them from low self-regulated learners in the later years of their study.

AB Eco-connectivist communities are groups of individuals with similar characteristics, which emerge in a connectivist learning process within a knowledge ecology. ARMAGAeco-c is a reflexive and autonomic middleware for the management and optimization of eco-connectivist knowledge ecologies using description, prediction and prescription models. Adaptive Learning Objects are autonomic components that seek to personalize Learning Objects according to certain contextual information, such as learning styles of the learner's, technological restrictions, among other aspects. MALO is a system that allows the management of Adaptive Learning Objects. One of the main challenges of the connectivist learning process is the adaptation of the educational context to the student needs. One of them is the learning objects. For this reason, this work has two objectives, specifying a data analytics task to determine the learning style of a student in an eco-connectivist community and, adapting instances of Adaptive Learning Objects using the learning styles of the students in the communities. We use graph theory to identify the referential member of each eco-connectivist community, and a learning paradigm detection algorithm to identify the set of activities, strategies, and tools that Adaptive Learning Objects instances should have, according to the learning style of the referential member. To test our approach, a case study is presented, which demonstrates the validity of our approach.

AB It is noticed that there is a relevant adoption of virtual learning environments (VLE) in higher education, especially in the distance modality. These environments, with the support of Big Data, can provide actions for teaching evaluation practice based on tools that meet the objectives of learning analytics (LA), according to models and life cycles already defined in the literature. The purpose of this study was to consolidate ten possible teaching actions based on these tools, models and life cycles, with the objective of confronting these actions with teachers involved from higher education institutions that work in distance education evidencing them through an experiment where they used six of these tools of teaching profile in their respective disciplines in VLE Moodie. For collection, two semi-structured questionnaires (pre and post-experiment) were used. It was characterized as results of this study that the tools that had the most highlight for LA actions were: Completion Progress (18.5%), Course Dedication (18.1%) and Level Up! (17.8%), followed by "evaluation /feedback" (13.0%)and "intervention" (12.0%) %), thus being compatible with the purpose of reaching the evaluative practice within VLE from these tools.

AB As Learning Analytics (LA) in the higher education setting increasingly transitions from a field of research to an implemented matter of fact of the learner's experience, the demand of practical guidelines to support its development is rising. LA Policies bring together different perspectives, like the ethical and legal dimensions, into frameworks to guide the way. Usually the first time learners get in touch with LA is at the act of consenting to the LA tool. Utilising an ethical (TRUESSEC) and a legal framework (GDPR), we question whether sincere consent is possible in the higher education setting. Drawing upon this premise, we then show how it might be possible to recognise the autonomy of the learner by providing LA as a service, rather than an intervention. This could indicate a paradigm shift towards the learner as empowered demander. At last, we show how this might be incorporated within the GDPR by also recognising the demand of the higher education institutions to use the learner's data at the same time. These considerations will in the future influence the development of our own LA policy: a LA criteria catalogue.

ID PERSPECTIVES
AB - Globally, with the recent technological advancement and innovative capabilities, Higher education institutions (HEI) are adopting information technology tools for teaching in online environments through virtual classroom platforms. Further, the administration of HEI is majorly concerned with students' employability skills and is always willing to empower students to achieve their career goals. The study explores the online e-learning tools like learning analytics and examine their impact on the employability skills of students of higher educational institutions for sustainable development. The paper investigates the mediation effect of learning analytics in influencing the online learning usefulness, and knowledge on the employability skills of the students. The study has used PLS-SEM approach to analyze the responses collected from 172 undergraduate students across universities of DelhiNCR to test the hypothesis. The results confirm a positive and significant mediation of learning analytics in the relationship of e-learning usefulness and knowledge in achieving employability skills.

AB In this paper we will describe the steps needed for the implementation of learning analytics tools in a massive open online course (MOOC) based on learning management system MOODLE and intended for language learning. MOOC in question is intended for learning of the Croatian language at the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages level A1, and it was started in 2017 in cooperation of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences University of Zagreb and the Central State Office for Croats Abroad. It has over 4400 participants (November 2019) and the interface is in English and Spanish language. Since learning analytics tools have been introduced to MOODLE, that set of tools will be used for the analysis. Data collected by the learning management system will be combined with the information gathered through the MATOMO (ex. PIWIK) web analytics platform. We will also present the initial results, as well as predictive models that were tested (both pre-made and custom). Implementation will include stakeholders from both institutions: management, course teachers and mentors, digital content creators and instructional designers, and IT support personnel. The use of learning analytics tools is intended for the evaluation, analysis and prediction of the participant drop-out, as well future redesign of the current MOOC structure / delivery.

   outcomes; education
AB The availability of large amounts of information associated with the teaching and learning process challenges researchers to explore this information by using learning analytics to obtain indicators that can contribute to improving the teaching and learning process, particularly in terms of learning outcomes and the relationship students have with the educational institutions they attend. Considering that failure and dropping out of school have very negative consequences for a large number of young people, we have sought to obtain indicators associated with these problems through the use of quantitative methodology and documental analysis procedures, by analyzing data from a sample of 1588 students with regard to their frequency of access to the virtual environment of the institution, the number of presences in onsite lessons, the number of course units they passed and the average mark in the course units they passed. From the obtained results, we emphasize that there is a degree of positive association, with moderate correlation, between each pair of the mentioned variables. After organizing the sample in four distinct groups resulting from the division of the data regarding the number of accesses to the institution virtual environment into quartiles, it was found that there are significant differences regarding the number of course units passed between the groups with higher numbers of accesses to the virtual learning environment and the ones with lower numbers of accesses, to the benefit of the groups with the greatest number of accesses.

AB This chapter looks into examining research studies of the last five years and presents the state of the art of Learning Analytics (LA) in the Higher Education (HE) arena. Therefore, we used mixed-method analysis and searched through three popular libraries, including the Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) conference, the SpringerLink, and the Web of Science (WOS) databases. We deeply examined a total of 101 papers during our study. Thereby, we are able to present an overview of the different techniques used by the studies and their associated projects. To gain insights into the trend direction of the different projects, we clustered the publications into their stakeholders. Finally, we tackled the limitations of those studies and discussed the most promising future lines and challenges. We believe the results of this review may assist universities to launch their own LA projects or improve existing ones.

AB The learning management systems (LMS) in the education sector is widely used and it evolved nowadays. It led to enormous and several of data from the students' activities using the online content. It generates a large amount of wasted and unused data and these issues cannot be processed and supported by the traditional learning analytics. The sophisticated technology of Big Data and also became a recent trend now is vastly evolved and relates to data-driven decision making. It is known as big data analytics and significance to apply for e-Learning in higher education institution. This paper reviews and explores the use of Big Data in e-Learning as the fundamental of Big Data and e-Learning and its' impact. Big Data Analytics has been proved as an effective approach for educational data mining and learning analytics.

AB With the development of a technology-supported environment, it is plausible to provide rich process-oriented feedback in a timely manner. In this paper, we developed a learning analytics dashboard (LAD) based on process-oriented feedback in iTutor to offer learners their final scores, sub-scale reports, and corresponding suggestions on further learning content. We adopted a quasi-experimental design to investigate the effectiveness of the report on students' learning. Ninety-four freshman from two classes participated in this research. The two classes were divided into the LAD group and the original analytics report (OAR) based on a product-oriented feedback group. Before the experiment, all the students took the prior knowledge assessment. After a semester's instruction, all the students took the post-test of the summative assessment. Results indicated that students in the LAD group experienced better learning effectiveness than students in the OAR group. LAD based on process-oriented feedback was also effective in improving the skill learning effectiveness of the students with low-level prior knowledge.

AB One of the main generic competencies in Higher Education is "Learning to Learn". The key component of this competence is the capacity for self-regulated learning (SRL). For this competence to be developed, peer feedback seems useful because it fosters evaluative judgement. Following the principles of peer feedback processes, an online peer feedback proposal was created in the context of complex tasks in several degree courses (n = 448 students) at the University of Barcelona. A specific didactic sequence supported by digital technologies through Moodle was designed and validated after a deep analysis of the theoretical underpinnings of SRL models. A peer review proposal was ratified by the students, who pointed out the benefits of both receiving and, especially, giving feedback. The integration of Moodle tools with external tools such as Personalized Learning Design was highly valued by reviewers (n = 3 expert judges) and the possibilities for students to monitor their own progress through task completion was revealed as a positive aspect. Furthermore, the creation of personalized alerts to support learning processes also received a very high rating. The final model includes the changes derived from the validation process and suggests a reliable technology-supported intervention in an LMS, which is transferable to a larger scale.

AB In Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) research, gaining a guideline to carry out appropriate scaffolding by analyzing mechanism of successful collaborative interaction and extracting indicators to identify groups where collaborative process is not going well, can be considered as the most important preoccupation, both for research and for educational implementation. And to study this collaborative learning process, different approaches have been tried. In this paper, we opt for the verbal data analysis; its advantage of this method is that it enables quantitative processing while maintaining qualitative perspective, with collaborative learning data of considerable size. However, coding large scale educational data is extremely time consuming and sometimes goes beyond men's capacity. So, in recent years, there have also been attempts to automate complex coding by using machine learning technology. In this background, with large scale data generated in our CSCL system, we have tried to implement automation of high precision coding utilizing deep learning methods, which are derived from the leading edge technology of machine learning. The results indicate that our approach with deep learning methods is promising, outperforming the machine learning baselines, and that the prediction accuracy could be improved by constructing models more sensitive to the context of conversation.

AB Learning Management Systems are web-based systems in which learners can interact with content/learning resources and assessments, as well as other learners and instructors. LMSs have been widely used especially since the beginning of the information age. In the context of this study, the aim was to determine the expectations and needs of the learners, who are considered to be one of the most important stakeholders of the LMSs. An open-ended questionnaire and a semi-structured interview form prepared by the researchers were used as data collection tools. Content analysis was performed to analyze open-ended questions and interview data. According to the findings it was seen that learners want more entertaining and self-monitoring environments, especially with the elements of gamification. It was also seen that the learning environments have reporting and predictive capability on student achievement. Learners' needs and expectations match with third-generation learning management systems. The third-generation learning management systems can be developed through educational data mining and learning analytics. Within the scope of this research, the learner expectations and needs were discussed in the context of the third generation learning management systems, intervention and types of intervention.

AB The Flipped Classroom (FC) is an instruction method, where the traditional lecture and homework sessions are inverted. Online material is given to students in order to gain necessary knowledge before class, while class time is devoted to application of this knowledge and reflection. The hypothesis is that there could be deep and creative discussions when teacher and students physically meet, which has known a significant surge of popularity in the past decade. A marked recent trend in the FC is the increased use of Learning Analytics (LA) to support the development of the FC and students' reflexive learning. The aim of this paper is to investigate the literature on applications of LA in FCs, and to determine the best practices and needs for technological development supporting LA in the FC by means of a scoping review. This literature review revealed that there is potential in using LA in the FC, especially as a means to predict students' learning outcome and to support adaptive learning and improvement on the curriculum. However, further long-term studies and development is necessary to encourage self-directed learning in students and to develop the whole of the FC for a more diverse population of students. We anticipate an increased and expanded use of LA to come, with focus on predictive and prescriptive analytics providing more adaptive learning experience. We also anticipate that LA will expand beyond data mining to correlate student performance and online engagement with the aim to include a wider range of possibilities of interventions and adaptation of the learning experience.

AB The current paper debates upon the importance of learning analytics, by underlining its place in current research directions and its influence in reshaping education with the aid of cutting-edge technologies. Definitions, successful examples of learning analytics tools, as well as the challenges of implementing them are revised. A special attention is awarded to learning analytics performed in social learning environments, due to their popularity and well-established value. In order to investigate the importance of learning analytics to end-users (students and teachers), a survey based on two questionnaires was performed and revealed the fact that advanced learning analytics features are highly requested in online environments. The questionnaires were filled by 59 IT teachers and more than 390 IT students, from various countries, fact that demonstrates the global significance of the study. Also, a model of developing a feasible social learning solution with learning analytics features is proposed, shaping thus the feature research directions.

AB Ethics and privacy issues have been recognized as important factors for acceptance and trustworthy implementation of learning analytics. A large number of different issues has been recognized in the literature. Guidelines related to these issues are continuously being developed and discussed in research literature. The aim of this research was to identify patterns of co-occurrence of issues and guidelines in research papers discussing ethics and privacy issues, to gain better understanding of relationships between different ethics and privacy issues arising during implementation of learning analytics in higher education. A total of 93 papers published between 2010 and 2021 were qualitatively analyzed, and nine categories of issues and respective guidelines related to ethics and privacy in learning analytics were identified. Association rules mining Apriori algorithm was applied, where 93 papers represented transactions, and 18 categories of issues or guidelines (nine each) represented items. Two clusters of issues co-occurring in papers were identified, corresponding to deontology ethics (related to rules and duties), and consequentialism ethics (related to consequences of unethical behavior).

AB As higher education increasingly moves to online and digital learning spaces, we have access not only to greater volumes of student data, but also to increasingly fine-grained and nuanced data. A significant body of research and existing practice are used to convince key stakeholders within higher education of the potential of the collection, analysis and use of student data to positively impact on student experiences in these environments. Much of the recent focus in learning analytics is around predictive modeling and uses of artificial intelligence to both identify learners at risk, and to personalize interventions to increase the chance of success.
   In this paper we explore the moral and legal basis for the obligation to act on our analyses of student data. The obligation to act entails not only the protection of student privacy and the ethical collection, analysis and use of student data, but also, the effective allocation of resources to ensure appropriate and effective interventions to increase effective teaching and learning.
   The obligation to act is, however tempered by a number of factors, including inter and intra-departmental operational fragmentation and the constraints imposed by changing funding regimes. Increasingly higher education institutions allocate resources in areas that promise the greatest return. Choosing (not) to respond to the needs of specific student populations then raises questions regarding the scope and nature of the moral and legal obligation to act. There is also evidence that students who are at risk of failing often do not respond to institutional interventions to assist them.
   In this paper we build and expand on recent research by, for example, the LACE and EP4LA workshops to conceptually map the obligation to act which flows from both higher education's mandate to ensure effective and appropriate teaching and learning and its fiduciary duty to provide an ethical and enabling environment for students to achieve success. We examine how the collection and analysis of student data links to both the availability of resources and the will to act and also to the obligation to act. Further, we examine how that obligation unfolds in two open distance education providers from the perspective of a key set of stakeholders those in immediate contact with students and their learning journeys the tutors or adjunct faculty.

AB Many educational institutions implement blended lectures using an LMS, but few studies exist that have analysed learning effects and how best to conduct learning modules. In this paper, we analysed students' learning activities and learning effects by using basic log data from an LMS on blended information literacy lectures to evaluate the lectures. In addition, we divided students into groups and analysed their differences by the number of learning effects and learning activities. The results show that some students showed no associations between the number of times they used teaching materials and their learning effects. We report the details of these differences and make suggestions for improvements in lectures. In addition, we propose three lecture patterns to encourage students' activities. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Compared to other platforms such as Coursera and EdX, FutureLearn is a relatively new player in the MOOC arena and received limited coverage in the Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining research. Founded by a partnership between the Open University in the UK, the BBC, The British Library and (originally) 12 universities in the UK, FutureLearn has two distinctive features relevant to the way their data is displayed and analyzed: 1) it was designed with a specific educational philosophy in mind which focuses on the social dimension of learning and 2) every learning activity provide opportunities for formal discussion and commenting. This workshop provides an opportunity to invite contributions and connect individual and groups to share their research activities on an international stage. As the first of its kind, this workshop will bring in a number of scholars and practitioners, as well as data scientists and analyst involved in the reporting, researching and developments emerging from the data offered by the platform.

AB This article considers how teachers and university administrators can use a significant amount of data stored in the information systems of institutions. Intelligent analysis of these learning processes is of great use in the higher education system. The use of learning analytics (LA) by a large number of higher educational institutions shows the interest and participation of universities in this matter. Learning analytics can tell a lot about the progress of students and the environment in which learning takes place. Intellectualization of educational analytics will help provide predictive models that can serve as a basis for quality assurance and quality improvement. This article gives an idea of the current level of LA development at the international level. The article also draws conclusions about the problems and limitations associated with learning analytics (LA). The existing experience has been studied, and the conclusion have been made about the existing limitations that prevent the wider use of LA.

AB This study evaluates the validity of an algorithm for measuring the efficiency of social learning networks in discussion forums accompanying MOOCs of conventional format, which consist of video lectures and problem assignments. The algorithm models social learning networks as a function of users knowledge seeking and knowledge disseminating tendencies across course topics and offers a means to optimize social learning networks by connecting users seeking and disseminating information on specific topics. We use the algorithm to analyze the social learning network manifest in the discussion format of a MOOC forum incorporating video lectures and problem assignments. As a measure of the degree that knowledge seekers and knowledge disseminators are connected in the network, we observe a very sparse network with few discussion participants and a limited range of topics. Hence, only small gains are available through optimization, since for a very sparse network, few connections can be made. The development of a metric for the analysis of social learning networks would provide instructors and researchers with a means to optimize online learning environments for empowering social learning. Finally, we discuss our findings with respect to the potential of self-optimizing discussion forums for supporting social learning online.

AB The recent focus on learning analytics to analyse temporal dimensions of learning holds a strong promise to provide insights into latent constructs such as learning strategy, self-regulated learning, and metacognition. There is, however, a limited amount of research in temporally-focused process mining in educational settings. Building on a growing body of research around event-based data analysis, we explore the use of process mining techniques to identify strategic and tactical learner behaviours. We analyse trace data collected in online activities of a sample of nearly 300 computer engineering undergraduate students enrolled in a course that followed a flipped classroom pedagogy. Using a process mining approach based on first order Markov models in combination with unsupervised machine learning methods, we performed intra- and inter-strategy analysis. We found that certain temporal activity traits relate to performance in the summative assessments attached to the course, mediated by strategy type. Results show that more strategically minded activity, embodying learner self-regulation, generally proves to be more successful than less disciplined reactive behaviours.

AB This paper presents a review study on the characteristics and patterns of personalised learning in the context of STEM and STEAM (or STE(A)M) education, which involves the disciplinary integration of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, as well as Arts. It covered a total of 63 papers published in 2011-2020 collected from Scopus and Google Scholar. The results show the widespread practice of personalised learning, and the United States was the country with most studies carried out. In terms of the level of education, secondary education was a major focus. Mathematics accounted for the largest proportion of subject discipline in the studies, followed by Science and Engineering. Blended environment was the most popular mode of education, followed by the face-to-face classroom. The most frequent objective of personalised learning was to cater for students' learning styles. The popular means to achieve personalised learning included the use of blended learning, learning analytics, and adaptive e-learning systems. Regarding the research issue, above half of the studies evaluated the impact or effectiveness of a technology, system or device for personalised learning. Based on the results, potential areas of future work are suggested, such as the contextualised practice of STE(A)M education in various countries, and the personalisation in interdisciplinary STE(A)M education.

AB Learning analytics is a rapidly evolving research discipline that uses the insights generated from data analysis to support learners as well as optimize both the learning process and environment. This paper studied students' engagement level of the Learning Management System (LMS) via a learning analytics tool, student's approach in managing their studies and possible learning analytic methods to analyze student data. Moreover, extensive systematic literature review (SLR) was employed for the selection, sorting and exclusion of articles from diverse renowned sources. The findings show that most of the engagement in LMS are driven by educators. Additionally, we have discussed the factors in LMS, causes of low engagement and ways of increasing engagement factors via the Learning Analytics approach. Nevertheless, apart from recognizing the Learning Analytics approach as being a successful method and technique for analyzing the LMS data, this research further highlighted the possibility of merging the learning analytics technique with the LMS engagement in every institution as being a direction for future research.

AB Today, Web Analytics (WA) is commonly used to obtain key information about users and their behavior on websites. Besides, with the rise of online learning, Learning Analytics (LA) emerged as a separate research field for collecting and analyzing learners' interactions on online learning platforms. Although the foundation of both methods is similar, WA has not been profoundly used for LA purposes. However, especially large-scale online learning environments may benefit from WA as it is more sophisticated and well-established in comparison to LA. Therefore, this paper aims to examine to what extent WA can be utilized in this context, without compromising the learners' data privacy. For this purpose, Google Analytics was integrated into the Massive Open Online Course platform of the Hasso Plattner Institute as a proof of concept. It was tested with two deployments of the platform: openHPI and openSAP, where thousands of learners gain academic and industry knowledge about engineering education. Besides capturing behavioral data, the platforms' existing LA dashboards were extended by WA metrics. The evaluation of the integration showed that WA covers a large part of the relevant metrics and is particularly suitable for obtaining an overview of the platform's global activity, but reaches its limitations when it comes to learner-specific metrics.

AB The growing popularity of flipped classes in higher education indicates mounting support of instructional strategies that integrate active learning (AL) techniques to help develop students' responsibility and control of their own learning through multiple ways of active classroom engagement with course content to which they have been given first exposure outside the classroom. The results of a trial of flipped lessons designed to enhance learning in an undergraduate college algebra course through out-of-class lecture videos followed by in-class problem-solving with discussion and practice exercises were described in the author's presentation in INTED 2016 [1].
   Following the case-study approach, the current paper builds on the data from the previous flipped lesson (FL) module trial, to explore the potential value of the data trace on the learning management system (LMS) that housed all course content accessed by the student cohort. Using learning analytics approaches, information about students' learning behaviour during the study period, which had been automatically collected and archived by the LMS, were extracted and utilized to further inform the study findings and to provide additional insight into the learning affordances, beyond what was evidenced by the brief online survey and the assessment results as affirmation of student satisfaction with using FL with integrated video in the college algebra course. Learning analytics data mined from the LMS perform a potential beneficial function towards the formulation of student-specific learning recommendations that optimize the student's mode of self-learning through consideration of metrics on motivation, time investment and preferences in learning strategies. The study displayed positive indications that implementation of the flipped class pedagogy using integrated videos enhances learning in the undergraduate college algebra course. Nonetheless, a caveat on conclusions and inferences from this study concerns design limitations in this small trial experiment.

AB Learning analytics are used to track learners' progress and empower educators and learners to make well-informed data-driven decisions. However, due to the distributed nature of the learning process, analytics need to be combined to offer broader insights into learner's behavior and experiences. Consequently, this paper presents an architecture of a learning ecosystem, that integrates and utilizes cross-platform analytics. The proposed cross-platform architecture has been put into practice via a Java programming course. After a series of studies, a proof of concept was derived that shows how cross-platform analytics amplify the relevant analytics for the learning process. Such analytics could improve educators' and learners' understanding of their own actions and the environments in which learning occurs.

AB Popularity of massive online open courses (MOOCs) allowed educational researchers to address problems which were not accessible few years ago. Although classical statistical techniques still apply, large datasets allow us to discover deeper patterns and to provide more accurate predictions of student's behaviors and outcomes. The goal of this tutorial was to disseminate knowledge on elementary data analysis tools as well as facilitate simple practical data analysis activities with the purpose of stimulating reflection on the great potential of large datasets. In particular, during the tutorial we introduce elementary tools for using machine learning models in education. Although the methodology presented here applies in any programming environment, we choose R and CARET package due to simplicity and access to the most recent machine learning methods.

AB Taiwan's Ministry of Education (MoE) started planning and promoting comprehensive Digital Learning Initiative in 2013. It is expected that teachers and students can use broadband networks in campus in 2017. Students can do online learning with different kinds of digital devices at any time. Besides, students can do ubiquitous learning by getting digital learning resources on cloud devices. Teachers can grasp innovative teaching strategies with the application of digital technology and design the learning activities that are more adaptive to individual students. Students have the information force of mobile learning, the abilities to use information tools and grasp the information, as well as Internet literacy and ethics. The learning model of education at all levels will transform into student-centered to facilitate justice, public, autonomy and adaptive learning opportunities as well as make students in the country and those in the city have equal digital learning opportunities. Digital Learning Initiative will have profound influence on education system. Education cloud (EduCloud) is the flagship of the digital learning initiative. This paper presents our research and experience of applying Big data analytics to the EduCloud. We address Big data infrastructure and analytics to cover the issues of data collection, cleaning, storage, query, analytics, and visualization in order to make EduCloud more suitable for teachers and students in Taiwan.

AB This paper is in response to the manuscript entitled "Student perceptions of privacy principles for learning analytics" (Ifenthaler and Schumacher, Student perceptions of privacy principles for learning analytics. Educational Technology Research and Development, 64(5), 923-938, 2016) from a practice perspective. Learning analytics (the use of data science methods to generate actionable educational insights) have great potential to impact learning practices during the shift to digital. In particular, they can help fill a critical information gap for students created by an absence of classroom-based cues and the need for increased self-regulation in the online environment, However the adoption of learning analytics in effective, ethical and responsible ways is non-trivial. Ifenthaler and Schumacher (2016) present important findings about students' perceptions of learning analytics' usefulness and privacy, signaling the need for a student-centered paradigm, but stop short of addressing its implications for the creation and adoption of learning analytics tools. In this paper we address this limitation by describing the three specific shifts needed in current learning analytics practice for analytics to be accepted by and effective for students: (1) involve students in the creation of analytic tools meant to serve them; (2) develop analytics that are contextualized, explainable and configurable; and (3) empower students' agency in using analytic tools as part of their larger process of learning. These shifts are currently in different stages of maturity and adoption in mainstream learning analytics practice. The primary implication of this work is a call to action for researchers and practitioners to rethink and reshape how students participate in the creation, interpretation and impact of learning analytics.

AB Learning analytics have great potential to support students' learning process and instructors' learning design, specially when presented as a visualization, visual-form LA, designed in conjunction with student reflections. This presentation represents a multi year mixed-methods study that collected students learning analytics from participation in retrieval practice activities, low-stake quizzes, and presented this data as visual from LA to help students to be cognizant of and reflect on their learning practices in order to improve retention and recall by implementing high impact learning practices. Quantitative and qualitative data was collected, analyzed, and integrated to generate insights regarding the impact of the design on students' study behaviors and students' self-awareness of these behaviors. Findings suggest that the integration is successful in developing autonomous learners that more often recognize and implement effective learning behaviors.

AB The design and evaluation of Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) is a complex issue where higher education institutions and learning analytics can play an important role. As an example of this, this paper presents a case study focused on the effect that service multiplexity of institutionally-powered PLEs has on the composition and structure of students' personal networks. The evaluation of the case was carried out using social network analysis as the particular approach to learning analytics.

AB To examine the similarities and differences between two closely related yet distinct fields - Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics (LA) - this study conducted a literature review of the empirical studies published in both fields. We synthesized 492 LA and 194 EDM articles published during 2015-2019. We compared the similarities and differences in research across the two fields by examining data analysis tools, common keywords, theories, and definitions listed. We found that most studies in both fields did not clearly identify a theoretical framework. For both fields, theories of self-regulated learning are most frequently used. We found, through keyword analysis, that both fields are closely related to each other as "learning analytics" is most frequently listed keyword for EDM and vice versa for LA. However, one notable difference relates to how LA studies listed social-related keywords whereas EDM studies listed keywords related to technical methods. The tools used for data analysis overlap largely but some of the LA studies listed tools for qualitative data analysis and social network analysis whereas EDM studies did not. Finally, the distinction of the two fields is defined differently by authors as some demarcate the differences whereas some address them interchangeably.

DE learning analytics; adoption; higher education; students' expectations
AB The potential of learning analytics (LA) to improve learning and teaching is high. Yet, the adoption of LA across countries still remains low. One reason behind this is that the LA services often do not adequately meet the expectations and needs of their key stakeholders, namely students and teachers. Presently, there is limited research focusing on the examination of the students' expectations of LA across countries, especially in the Nordic, largely highly digitalized context. To fill this gap, this study examines Swedish students' attitudes of LA in a higher education institution. To do so, the validated survey instrument, Student Expectations of Learning Analytics Questionnaire (SELAQ) has been used. Through the application of SELAQ, the students' ideal and predicted expectations of the LA service and their expectations regarding privacy and ethics were examined. Data were collected in spring 2021. 132 students participated in the study. The results show that the students have higher ideal expectations of LA compared to the predicted ones, especially in regards to privacy and ethics. Also, the findings illustrate that the respondents have low expectations in areas related to the instructor feedback, based on the analytics results. Further, the results demonstrate that the students have high expectations on the part of the university in matters concerning privacy and ethics. In sum, the results from the study can be used as a basis for implementing LA in the selected context.

AB A significant number of instructors, researchers and students have claimed that chemistry is a challenging subject to teach and learn at all education levels. Its main learning difficulties are in line with certain sights of its phenomena that are abstract, and some chemistry teachers do not specify what to be learned and assessed in chemistry lesson. The current work investigates the use of formative assessment rubrics for supporting secondary school students' progressive learning in organic chemistry through a technology-based learning project approach in Rwanda. The investigators used a convergent parallel research design, and quantitative data were gathered by distributing questionnaires to the students, and the answers were statistically analyzed. Qualitative data were obtained through observation and interview and were narratively analyzed. The results from this study showed that rubric-based formative assessment supported students' learning of organic chemistry via technology-based learning approach. This is accredited to the fact that students were motivated while doing their assessment and they were able to do self-assessment by applying the provided rubrics via technology. The students understood instructors' expectations, encouraged their learning, sharpened their technology skills, and their knowledge retention was also increased. The instructors were able to grade the students' tasks fast with the help of an analytic rubric and good formative feedback was availed to students on time. The instructors were also able to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of the learners and give them quick formative feedback.

AB Language learning occurring in authentic contexts has been shown to be more effective. Virtual worlds provide simulated contexts that have the necessary elements of authentic contexts for language learning, and as a result, many studies have adopted virtual worlds as a useful platform for language learning. However, few studies so far have examined the relationship between learning outcomes and learning paths and strategies inside a virtual world. This study was designed to fill this research gap. In order to understand the impact of different learning strategies on learning outcomes in a virtual world, a visualization analytic method was developed to examine the recorded learner paths within a virtual world while learning occurred. In particular, the visualization analytic method adopted in this study was based on social network analysis. This study included 14 participants who were learners of Mandarin Chinese as a foreign language. The learning outcomes were based on their test scores from 7 learning sessions and the post-test. Through the visualization analysis, the current study revealed a link between the learning paths and strategies and learners' outcomes. The strategies include the "nearest strategy," the "focus strategy," and the "cluster strategy." The findings show that high-achieving and low-achieving students tend to use different strategies in learning new words. The visualization analytics thus effectively displays the learning strategies of vocabulary acquisition. Our methods could be applied to other second language learning studies, and the results can also provide insights into the construction of future virtual worlds for learning second languages.

AB After the COVID-19 pandemic, universities moved towards online and Blended Learning (BL) modes to offer greater curricular flexibility. Yet, recent research shows that students have difficulties regulating their learning strategies to adapt to the different learning modes that BL entails, which mixes face-to-face with online activities taking place in different learning contexts and environments. Prior work on Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) has explored the use of dashboard-based scaffolds for supporting students' learning strategies. However, most existing solutions are designed for supporting students in online settings (i.e., MOOCs), disregarding the teachers' role in BL settings and the support they need to monitor and promote students' SRL. This paper presents the design process followed for transforming a tool designed for supporting students' SRL in MOOCs into a Moodle plugin for BL. Following a design-based research methodological approach, we describe all the phases conducted for identifying the most appropriate indicators and visualizations for supporting SRL in BL practices, implementing and evaluating a first prototype. Results of a local evaluation with 114 teachers and a broad evaluation with 311 students shed some light on the type of indicators, dashboards and functionalities that should be considered when designing solutions for supporting SRL in BL settings.

AB IT approach has been gradually applied in collaborative learning groups in higher education nowadays. However, it is still difficult to measure and assess each student's engagement in learning groups. Moreover, how to promote students' engagement in learning groups is also an important problem. Learning analytics in IT environment helps us understand the whole process of students' learning in groups, analyze these problems in collaborative learning and find ways to improve group learning effect. We examined the role of Slack in students' engagement in collaborative learning. Specifically, whether the openness and visibility of each group member's contribution on Slack can promote students' engagement. Based on the benefits and loss of engagement, we proposed the research model and hypotheses. Surveys (n = 181) were issued online to postgraduate students at different times of a course in China. Data was analysed by SmartPLS. Results show that mutual trust, social influence and reward valence among students can promote their teamwork engagement. Furthermore, teamwork engagement can prompt students' learning and work satisfaction. However, the moderation role of task complexity between teamwork engagement and personal success (i.e. learning and work satisfaction) is not supported. Theoretical contribution and implications for educational practices are discussed. Research limitations and future research directions are also presented. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Despite theoretical benefits of replayability in educational games, empirical studies have found mixed evidence about the effects of replaying a previously passed game (i.e., elective replay) on students' learning. Particularly, we know little about behavioral features of students' elective replay process after experiencing failures (i.e., interruptive elective replay) and the relationships between these features and learning outcomes. In this study, we analyzed 5th graders' log data from an educational game, ST Math, when they studied fractions-one of the most important but challenging math topics. We systematically constructed interruptive elective replay features by following students' sequential behaviors after failing a game and investigated the relationships between these features and students' post-test performance, after taking into account pretest performance and in-game performance. Descriptive statistics of the features we constructed revealed individual differences in the elective replay process after failures in terms of when to start replaying, what to replay, and how to replay. Moreover, a Bayesian multi-model linear regression showed that interruptive elective replay after failures might be beneficial for students if they chose to replay previously passed games when failing at a higher, more difficult level in the current game and if they passed the replayed games.

AB Games-based learning is a young discipline and there is no consensus on how learning objectives should be integrated into learning games. Utilisation of the educational content in digital games is an increasing trend that sometimes has been described as a mad rush where sound educational principles often are absent. A design of educational games with a careless mix of game mechanics and learning content could also result in so called "Shavian reversals", an outcome where the offspring inherits the worst characteristics of both parents. What guidelines are important in a learning model, for a successful combination of engaging game stories and appropriate learning content? Designing educational games should include all the stages of the software design process. Also, there are specific problems in the design of educational games that need to be addressed. These are related to the integration of learning content and game mechanics in games, and the technologies required for its implementation. The paper will take a dual perspective on flow and cooperative learning theories. When embedding the learning principles within the design of the digital games, the process has to consider the role of knowledge, meaning and reflective learning process. It will also suggest guidance from those supporting the learning. Also, the way that the mechanics are implemented in an educational game, are measured using specified metrics and a novel technique called learning analytics. The paper discusses modern approaches of educational game design and their effectiveness in keeping the game both educational and engaging. It also proposes specific ways that evaluation metrics are used in game analytics and how they can provide feedback to check if the educational objectives are achieved. Furthermore, new ideas are suggested on how to combine game-flow and learning objectives in educational games, with a result that would not lead to the Shavian reversal effect, but instead will keep the game both educational and engaging. A combined script model is presented in which each learning objective is interpreted as a game objective and a game process. The model is structured as a sequence of activities combining learning objectives and game actions. Furthermore, there is an exemplification of how the suggested script model might be implemented in role-playing and casual games.

AB The majority of the learning analytics research focuses on the prediction of course performance and modeling student behaviors with a focus on identifying students who are at risk of failing the course. Learning analytics should have a stronger focus on improving the quality of learning for all students, not only identifying at risk students. In order to do so, we need to understand what successful patterns look like when reflected in data and subsequently adjust the course design to avoid unsuccessful patterns and facilitate successful patterns.
   However, when establishing these successful patterns, it is important to account for individual differences among students since previous research has shown that not all students engage with learning resources to the same extent. Regulation strategies seem to play an important role in explaining the different usage patterns students' display when using digital learning recourses. When learning analytics research incorporates contextualized data about student regulation strategies we are able to differentiate between students at a more granular level.
   The current study examined if regulation strategies could account for differences in the use of various learning resources. It examines how students regulated their learning process and subsequently used the different learning resources throughout the course and established how this use contributes to course performance.
   The results show that students with different regulation strategies use the learning resources to the same extent. However, the use of learning resources influences course performance differently for different groups of students. This paper recognizes the importance of contextualization of learning data resources with a broader set of indicators to understand the learning process. With our focus on differences between students, we strive for a shift within learning analytics from identifying at risk students towards a contribution of learning analytics in the educational design process and enhance the quality of learning; for all students.

AB Game learning analytics has a great potential to provide insight and improve the use of games in different educational situations. However, it is necessary to clearly establish what the learner's requirements are and to set realistic expectations about the learning process and outcomes. Application of game learning analytics requires pedagogically informed policies that settle the learning goals and relate them to analysis and visualization; and a supporting infrastructure that provides the mechanism on top of which it is executed. Both concerns can be addressed separated: on the one hand, there is a Learning Analytics Model (LAM) which describes how the analysis is carried out, interpreted as learning, and presented to stakeholders; and on the other hand, an underlying analytics system that concentrates on performance, security, flexibility and generality. An important advantage of this separation is that it allows LAM authors to concentrate on their area of expertise, limiting their exposition to the actual mechanism used underneath. However, LAMs built for a single game fail to account for the frequent case where games and their analytics arc aggregated into larger, overarching plots, games or courses. This work describes an extension to an existing game learning analytics system, used in RAGE and BEACONING H2020 projects, which manages multilevel analytics through improvements to both policy and mechanism; and introduces meta-Learning Analytic Models, which characterize learning in hierarchical structures.

AB Digital learning environments are becoming more common for students to engage in during and outside of school. With the immense amount of data now available from these environments, researchers need tools to process, manage, and analyze the data. Current methods used by many education researchers are inefficient; however, without data science experience tools used in other professions are not accessible. In this paper, we share about a tool we created called the Functional Understanding Navigator! (FUN! Tool). We have used this tool for different research projects which has allowed us the opportunity to (1) organize our workflow process from start to finish, (2) record log data of all of our analyses, and (3) provide a platform to share our analyses with others through GitHub. This paper extends and improves existing work in educational data mining and learning analytics.

AB Utilization of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been penetrated not only in regular classes, but also in resource rooms, or we call Special Needs Class (SNC), in Japan. Its study has been a popular research target among stakeholders for special needs education, however, there is little reported on discussing how log data can be used to support teaching and learning for children who need special support. In this paper, we propose implementation of using BookRoll (BR), a learning analytic enhanced e-book in SNC. For a pilot study, three participants who attend SNC were selected from an elementary school. Their handwritings with a touch-pen left in a memo function in BR were visible as logs in an analysis tool to illustrate the outcomes of their performance which enabled to trace their learning difficulties. Parents' intervention as limitation and introducing Learning Evidence Analysis Framework (LEAF) system and learning support for children with special needs from the field of educational learning analytics are suggested.

AB Educational data contains valuable information that can be harvested through learning analytics to provide new insights for a better education system. However, sharing or analysis of this data introduce privacy risks for the data subjects, mostly students. Existing work in the learning analytics literature identifies the need for privacy and pose interesting research directions, but fails to apply state of the art privacy protection methods with quantifiable and mathematically rigorous privacy guarantees. This work aims to employ and evaluate such methods on learning analytics by approaching the problem from two perspectives: (1) the data is anonymized and then shared with a learning analytics expert, and (2) the learning analytics expert is given a privacy-preserving interface that governs her access to the data. We develop proof-of-concept implementations of privacy preserving learning analytics tasks using both perspectives and run them on real and synthetic datasets. We also present an experimental study on the trade-off between individuals' privacy and the accuracy of the learning analytics tasks.

AB The classroom climate is shaped by a combination of teacher practices and peer relationships. The Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) has been designed to observe and code classroom interactions between students and teachers in order to provide formative feedback on teaching practices and improve teacher instruction. But the turnover time for training, observing and coding makes it hard to generate instant feedback. Since there are few automated assessment tools designed to measure the classroom climate, we propose a novel system for automatic assessment of classroom climate, based on speech, behavioral cues and video features by applying machine learning techniques. This paper elaborates on the design and validation of an audio-video analytics platform for predicting classroom climate. Employing machine learning classifiers instead of subjective measures can ease and expedite the coding. We presume our system can empower education systems to continuously review and improve teaching strategies thus promoting smart classroom in the future.

AB This paper is based on (a) a literature review focussing on the impact of learning analytics on supporting learning and teaching, (b) a Delphi study involving international expert discussion on current opportunities and challenges of learning analytics as well as (c) outlining a research agenda for closing identified research gaps. Issues and challenges facing educators linked to learning analytics and current research gaps were organised into four themes, the further development of which by the expert panel, led to six strategy and action areas. The four themes are 1. development of data literacy in all stakeholders, 2. updating of guiding principles and policies of educational data, 3. standards needed for ethical practices with data quality assurance, and 4. flexible user-centred design for a variety of users of analytics, starting with learners and ensuring that learners and learning is not harmed. The strategies and actions are outcomes of the expert panel discussion and are offered as provocations to organise and focus the researcher, policymaker and practitioner dialogs needed to make progress in the field.

AB Virtual Reality offers many opportunities for use in learning and teaching. However, the creation of Virtual Reality learning opportunities need many resources. Systematic efforts are needed to design learning activities and prepare them for research to be able to show learning effectiveness in the future. This paper describes the planning, development and the evaluation method of Virtual Reality learning activities for Computer Graphics education. The focus is on the development process of the didactic concept, as well as the immersive Virtual Reality environment. Through the early integration of Learning Analytics components, the foundations for exploring insights into the learning processes are implemented. The methodical combination of software and didactic development offers the advantages of both approaches; the systematic collection of learning data enables early didactic monitoring and hypothesis generation for research.

AB Within the last few years mobile learning has become very popular. Many projects and case studies explore its usefulness in the educational sector, i.e. at schools and universities. Few, however, deal with work place learning. LogiAssist is an educational assistance and learning platform for truck drivers. This paper first explores how eager truck drivers are to engage in online learning and the usage of an assistance system. This is juxtaposed with first results of the actual usage of LogiAssist. In a second step, we explore how the system was used and how the usage can be interpreted from a learning analytics point of view.

AB While online learning is already a part of university education and didactics, not all students have the necessary self regulation competency to really learn on their own efficiently and effectively. In classroom a teacher can take over a moderating part, set intermediate goals and give feedback to one's progress, but participants of online learning courses (e.g. in blended scenarios or Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)) face a higher demand of self-regulation competency. This paper presents a course and content independent assistant, PeerLA, which assists in improving self-regulation competency. PeerLA allows setting of long-term goals, breakdown into intermediate goals and keeps track of knowledge increase or time needed. A graphical feedback allows comparison of existing and aimed level of knowledge or time investments. PeerLA adds peer comparison to the visualization charts for social frame of reference. This comparison is course-wide or only with similar learners (close in goals and knowledge levels). PeerLA is implemented as a Learning Management System (LMS) plugin to support learning progress in mixed formal and informal learning scenarios. PeerLA was evaluated with 83 students in an online mathematics preparation course over four weeks. Results indicate the benefits of such a self-regulation assistance, especially for university freshmen.

DT Article
DE Learning analytics; multimodal learning analytics; multiple

AB This paper develops a theoretical framework for employing learning analytics in online education to trace multiple learning variations of online students by considering their potential of being multiple intelligences based on Howard Gardner's 1983 theory of multiple intelligences. The study first emphasizes the need to facilitate students as multiple intelligences by online education systems and then suggests a framework of the advanced form of learning analytics i.e., multimodal learning analytics for tracing and facilitating multiple intelligences while they are engaged in online ubiquitous learning. As multimodal learning analytics is still an evolving area, it poses many challenges for technologists, educationists as well as organizational managers. Learning analytics make machines meet humans, therefore, the educationists with an expertise in learning theories can help technologists devise latest technological methods for multimodal learning analytics and organizational managers can implement them for the improvement of online education. Therefore, a careful instructional design based on a deep understanding of students' learning abilities, is required to develop teaching plans and technological possibilities for monitoring students' learning paths. This is how learning analytics can help design an adaptive instructional design based on a quick analysis of the data gathered. Based on that analysis, the academicians can critically reflect upon the quick or delayed implementation of the existing instructional design based on students' cognitive abilities or even about the single or double loop learning design. The researcher concludes that the online education is multimodal in nature, has the capacity to endorse multiliteracies and, therefore, multiple intelligences can be tracked and facilitated through multimodal learning analytics in an online mode. However, online teachers' training both in technological implementations and adapting educational theories to online education is necessary to achieve this ideal.

AB This paper describes emergent learning and situates it within learning networks and systems and the broader learning ecology of Web 2.0. It describes the nature of emergence and emergent learning and the conditions that enable emergent, self-organised learning to occur and to flourish. Specifically, it explores whether emergent learning can be validated and self-correcting and whether it is possible to link or integrate emergent and prescribed learning. It draws on complexity theory, communities of practice, and the notion of connectivism to develop some of the foundations for an analytic framework, for enabling and managing emergent learning and networks in which agents and systems co-evolve. It then examines specific cases of learning to test and further develop the analytic framework.
   The paper argues that although social networking media increase the potential range and scope for emergent learning exponentially, considerable effort is required to ensure an effective balance between openness and constraint. It is possible to manage the relationship between prescriptive and emergent learning, both of which need to be part of an integrated learning ecology.

AB The aim of learning analytics (LA) is to understand and optimize learning and the environments in which it occurs. Given the complex nature of learning it has become necessary to use tools from various fields of research to obtain, describe, analyze and interpret data about students, their learning processes and contexts. Rather than taking isolated methods or techniques for the study of this process, learning analytics is beginning to integrate the perspectives of other fields to achieve a research of learning with a transdisciplinary vision. One of these fields is neurosciences, specifically those related to learning or educational neurosciences. The objective of this research is to explore the implications and challenges of the use of EEG technologies (traditionally used in neurological studies) in conjunction with learning analytics for the study of students learning processes and their context.

AB Research in learning analytics is proliferating as scholars continue to find better and more engaging ways to consider how data can help inform evidence-based decisions for learning and learning environments. With well over a thousand articles published in journals and conferences with respect to learning analytics, only a handful or articles exist that attempt to synthesize the research. Further, a meta-review of those articles reveals a lack of consistency in the scope of included studies, the confluence of educational data mining activities and "big data" as a parameter for inclusion, and the reporting of actual strategies and analytic methods used by the included studies. To fill these gaps within existing reviews of learning analytics research, this metasynthesis follows procedures outlined by Cooper to reveal developments of learning analytics research. The results include a number of metrics showing trends and types of learning analytic studies through 2017 that include which fields are publishing and to what extent, what methods and strategies are employed by these studies, and what domains remain largely yet unexplored.

AB New pedagogical methodologies have been proposed to transform student learning. One of them is gamification, it is based on the use of the game as element in educational contexts. The studies in this topic show that the use of gamification in engineering courses has positive results. The combination of pedagogical methodologies such as flipped learning, and collaborative learning with gamification are promising.
   This work shows the experience of flipped learning with collaborative learning and gamification, applied to a mathematics for engineering workshop, with new students. Course includes basic concepts of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, analytic geometry, and trigonometry. The material is made up of 68 multimedia educational resources with the explanation of concepts and solved examples, online exercises, self-evaluations and games. Multimedia educational resources are integrated into learning objects from a virtual learning environment.
   Students are guided by a structure with rules similar to the games, include: competitions, use of simulators, collaborative forums, among others.
   The benefits of integrating different pedagogical methodologies were: high percentage of approval, increase student interest in course topics, have fun with programmed activities, learn to share their knowledge with other students.

ID MODEL
AB How can we best facilitate students most in need of learning support, entering a challenging quantitative methods module at the start of their bachelor programme? In this empirical study into blended learning and the role of assessment for and as learning, we investigate learning processes of students with different learning profiles. Specifically, we contrast learning episodes of two cluster analysis-based profiles, one profile more directed to deep learning and self-regulation, the other profile more directed toward stepwise learning and external regulation. In a programme based on problem-based learning, where students are supposedly being primarily self-directed, this first profile is regarded as being of an adaptive type, with the second profile less adaptive. Making use of a broad spectrum of learning and learner data, collected in the framework of a dispositional learning analytics application, we compare these profiles on learning dispositions, such as learning emotions, motivation and engagement, learning performance and trace variables collected from the digital learning environments. Outcomes suggest that the blended design of the module with the digital environments offering many opportunities for assessment of learning, for learning and as learning together with actionable learning feedback, is used more intensively by students of the less adaptive profile.

AB In the information age, one of the most influential institutions is education. The recent emergence of MOOCS is a sample of the new expectations that are offered to university students. Basing decisions on data and evidence seems obvious, and indeed, research indicates that data-driven decision-making improves organizational productivity. The most dramatic factor shaping the future of higher education is Big Data and analytics. Big Data emphasizes that the data itself is a path to value generation in organizations and it is, also, a critical value for higher education institutions. The emerging practice of academic analytics is likely to become a new useful tool for a new era. Analytics and big data have a significant role to play in the future of higher education. This paper attempts an analytical practice about the use of e-learning technological tools to generate relevant information, for the teacher and the students who try to optimize their learning process. This combination of data-processing and analytical learning is an aid to improve significantly higher education and mark the path to follow in the new educational era.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Educational games can act as excellent learning environments, where learners play and learn at the same time. However, typically, once a game has been developed, it is launched and then maybe evaluated for learning effectiveness but details on how learners actually use the game as well as how they play and learn in the game are rarely investigated. In addition, which groups of learners are more attracted or less attracted by the game is seldom looked at. However, such investigations are essential to ensure that the game is used in the way it was intended, that the game is fun and provides learning opportunities at the same time, that learners can benefit the most from the game and to make the game interesting for many different groups of players. In this paper, we introduce a learning analytics approach that builds learner profiles based on learners' characteristics and behaviour in the educational game OMEGA+. The approach is rather generic and can be easily adapted to other educational games. By using the proposed learning analytics approach, clusters of learners are built that provide insights into how learners use the game, how they play and how they learn. In addition, when considering demographic attributes when analysing the clusters, insights can be gained on which groups of learners are more and which groups are less attracted to the game.
