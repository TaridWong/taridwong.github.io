Welcome to my blog on psychometric, data science, and tidbits about my academic lives!\r\n            I am Tarid, a doctoral student in the the Measurement, Evaluation, and Data Science program at the University of Alberta.\r\n            As a researcher (or someone who tries to be), my primary area of interest is in the usage of quantitative methods to address research problems in educational measurement and other social issues pertaining to social science.\r\n            Be that as it may, I also seek to use qualitative and mixed methods research skills whenever it makes sense to understand social phenomena from another perspective as well. I have also been learning to use tools in data science such as data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing to gain insights at a broader perspective with large-scale data.\r\n            I hope by sharing what I learned (and rant about what I encountered), I could provide some food for thoughts for you readers and potentially inspire some of you along the line in what you are doing.\r\n            Thank you for visiting!\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Hobbies\r\n            Video games!: I play lots of games on Nintendo switch and PC, Skyrim, the Witcher 3, Left4Dead 2, the Legend of Zelda, Super Mario, JRPGs, you name it!\r\n            Strolling outdoor : Sometimes when the weather is nice, I like to stroll outside without a plan and let my thoughts flow freely for once.\r\n            Memeing: I pride myself as a meme lord with my criminally twisted humor.
